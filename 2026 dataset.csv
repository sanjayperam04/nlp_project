The flight to Munich was full of people from the original canceled flight to Prague, who subsequently wanted to continue to Prague. Although the Adria Airways staff were present at the airport, no one came to inform the passengers and the result was tremendous confusion and lack of information. Ljubljana airport servicing staff finally informed us that Adria Airways staff refused to come! Also wasn't possible to call the Adria Airways hotline.

ATR-72,Adria Airways,Economy Class,Sep-17,5th December 2017,0,1,1,UnitedStates,3,no,"Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations.

Adria Airways as the national carrier pretty much holds a monopoly in this market and even those few carriers who had flown limited scheduled routes into the Slovenian capital, Air France and Swiss, have regretfully withdrawn their services. I have spent a lifetime of flying and the Adria product, I am sorry to say, is grossly inadequate. There is nothing appealing about Adria's offering and what incentive do they have to lift their standard when there is no competition to stimulate improvement? The entire fleet is tired and outdated. The business class product is non existent, staff are at best disinterested, leaning towards unfriendly. And what's with those announcements? They are completely impossible to understand, not just in English and German but also in Slovenian. If not having flown as often as I have to know what the announcements are about, there is no hope in hell that a normal person can understand the dribble that comes over the PA. Guess how many uninformed passengers does that make for? If one is not fluent in a language, and heavily accented, then one must slow down so others can hopefully understand you. But what's their excuse of not pronouncing Slovenian correctly. Everything is executed at such a speed so they can place a tick against that task, yet no care is invested to make sure the task is executed effectively. ! Pick up your game or your end will come one day when monopoly is broken (look around the world to learn from other such stories).  I have found a solution to avoid flying Adria Airways where possible - Turkish Airlines presence is now pretty strong in LJU and I can't fault their service.

CRJ-900,Adria Airways,Economy Class,Oct-16,10th October 2016,2,1,2,Netherlands,3,no,"✅ , |  Ljubljana to Amsterdam. First experience with Adria Airways was underwhelming and unimpressive. Flight sat on tarmac fully boarded for 20 minutes without explanation; causing 20 minute delay on arrival without comment from crew and despite many passengers with tight connections in AMS. Crew was the least personal I've experienced in my 30+ flights in 2016. The crew quickly passed through the cabin holding a large bottle of water but without offering it; everything else is buy-on-board at unappealing prices. Aging CRJ-900 showed its wear, limited on-air entertainment, but able to select bulkhead seat at check-in so legroom was good. Compared to inbound flight on Air France, Adria lacked any sort of the polished, personal touch that its in-flight magazine claims it wants to project. To LJU, however, the options are few and the schedules erratic, so Adria will often be the only rational choice for many sectors.",LJU to AMS,3,1,adria-airways,underwhelming and unimpressive,Solo Leisure,,2,0,7d597a9f-0578-4892-8825-47bbde83d25a

I hate that they never board on time neither depart on time. For 20 pax you should be in the air in about 15 min. But they lose a lot of time after the boarding is completed and the take off. The service is worse every time. Now you get a small pack of seeds or dry fruit and a bottle of water. The flights are normally only 30 mins but nevertheless I miss the nice box with good sandwich water and a small dessert. The price is well overpriced for what they offer.

So by the time I landed at Mexico City, got off the plane, got my luggage and got to the ticket counter of Aeromexico, my next flight was taking off towards Los Angeles. I thought that Aeromexico / Delta would just put me on the next flight. First, they made me visit different ticket counters which took another 45 minutes and at the end said that they couldn't do anything about it and I would have to buy a whole new ticket. The first ticket that I bought online cost me about $125 usd, but now this new ticket to LA cost me almost $300 usd. After I bought my ticket, went to the Aeromar ticket counter, which was in total disarray, and tried to talk with the supervisor. He gave me an email to write to and sent me on my way. Since then I wrote them twice and have received discouraging emails. Yesterday it took me two hours on the phone with them, going through 3 levels of management for them to give me a ""courtesy flight"" worth $80 usd and I still have to pay the tax. I ask them what would of happened if my whole family was with me, we would have spent $3,000 usd? He said that there is nothing that they could do, so much for customer service. So that is why I think I will never fly with them again.  In the old days we had no choice, but now there are 3 more airlines here in Puerto.

Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical.

This airline tries hard to fill the gap left by the collapse of Aero Lloyd Boliviano but is still plagued by constant changes to schedules usually because the aircraft flying the international route (Brazil) is late in arriving in Santa Cruz and therefore delays the local flights. It also tends to overbook flights and then moves confirmed ticket holders to later flights (it is really important to reconfirm flights) and will even change flight schedules back in time so flights depart 2 hours earlier then scheduled.

My premium economy flight from Kumasi to Accra was delayed by 2 hours after checking in but nobody from the airline told us any reason. All the passengers were crowded into a small area with no social distancing as if there was no pandemic happening. When we finally boarded the flight, the hostess was constantly removing her nose mask to flirt with some politician in the front seat. I asked her for a cup of coffee and was refused because she said only water is allowed due to COVID. For the extra price that we are paying for premium economy and the number of hours that they hold us hostage we deserve better! The seat was dirty and the armrest plastic was chipped, while the signs on the ancient noisy plane were all in Chinese. You could feel the plane shaking the whole time during the flight which makes you wonder if they even do proper maintenance. We finally reached our destination nearly 3 hours late but my baggage did not arrive. There were people from earlier flights also waiting there for their bags so this seems to be a very common thing.

They also require you to pay 50,000 Naira to take an expensive Covid test before they allow you to board their flights.

There was no notice from the airline, we received the email after we were told that it was cancelled. The customer service response was not professional. When asked for why it was cancelled, we were notified that it was a technical problem which is surprising that 4-hours before the flight, only then did they think about confirming a cancelled flight. Normally, airlines would provide compensation to make sure the customer is not inconvenienced. Their first question was, ""do you have a place to stay here in Ghana?"" This of course should not be the first question to ask a customer who is not from the country. Had it not been for the collective anger and frustration of all passengers on the original flight, there would not have been any quick movement to get us on another flight. Even though it is a small airline or growing airline, the experience was more frustrating for us as a customer. Lastly, the manager or person in charge of transferring us to another flight did not care enough to get our contact information to notify us that we had successfully been transferred to another flight. Instead, when we happened to pass by again he looked at us surprised saying ""Why are you here? You should be checking in right now at the other airline!"".

Tripoli airport isn't a pleasure but no worse than you would expect and every landing seemed calmer than I am used to on the bigger planes. Two big faults though: firstly we had to turn the plane around for a sick passenger and no one made any announcement until about 5 seconds before landing which made most of us think we had turned around for a plane fault. Secondly on the outward flight my bags arrived two days late. Not a disaster for me but certainly it could have been for some people. No apology no attempt to trace me when the bag arrived (though they said they were just about to). Also only 3 movies for 26 hours of flying.

A couple of days later the original return flight was totally cancelled. I was later offered in return another ticket two days earlier or full refund. Upon choosing the full refund I got back less than 40% of my paid amount for this trip and the argument was that they only full refund the return ticket that was changed and the outbound ticked is non refundable.

I was always a little annoyed with them. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes the day before my flight to reserve seats for the flights and when I showed up to the airport they had no record of my phone call (even though I had gotten an email with seat confirmation) and they had already given away our seats. Given that we had an international flight on our itinerary, we were entitled to two checked bags for each of our flight legs, and every single time they tried to charge us and we had to remind them that we got two free bags - I think they were trying to dupe us. What was most frustrating was that they cancelled our flight home with just over 24 hours advance notice because of a ""technical difficulty"" with the plane, and instead of having the direct flight from Buenos Aires to JFK that we paid for, they re-booked us (after 1 hour on hold) on a flight to New Jersey. I had a connection from JFK to Boston that I obviously missed, and ended up having to pay for another very expensive flight. I filed a claim and never heard back. I called once to follow up and after 45 minutes on hold I was promised that all claims were addressed within 22 days. 22 days came and went and I never heard back again. I made four additional follow-up phone calls, and each time I was on hold from anywhere from 10 to 45 minutes before I could speak to someone. Every person I spoke to gave a different explanation - from this is the wrong phone number to claims take 2 months (not 22 days) to call Expedia. When I finally started asking to speak to supervisors, two times I was actually hung up on.

A340,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,Mar-16,3rd April 2016,3,3,2,NetherlandsAntilles,7,yes,"✅ , |  I recently flew from Bogotá to Buenos Aires and back on Aerolineas Argentinas. I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground. To me their way of dealing with business class passenger in the check-in procedure leave much (!) to be desired. They did not treat us special, on the contrary.

I am 5'5 and was also uncomfortable. It was a long flight almost 9 hours and the TV screens did not function properly. Mine had no image whatsoever. My husband's screen had image but no sound. No entertainment at all for almost 9 hours is ridiculous. We had to take a second flight from Buenos Aires to Bahia Blanca and the flight was delayed 2 hours. On our return from Buenos Aires to Miami the flight was also delayed this time for 1 hour. Even tough the prices of Aerolineas Argentinas are lower I would never use it again or recommended to anybody. I have taken the same flight route with American Airlines and LAN and they are much better. Next time I rather pay more for the tickets and have a more pleasant and comfortable flight.,,1,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,ea01aa25-7bba-4f3e-9f92-54bd5d5f5125

Well I'm happy to report that with Aerolineas Argentinas you don't ""get what you pay for"" you get much more. The plane we took was an elderly Airbus that was a bit tattered (especially the bathrooms) but the seats were lie-flat and comfortable the food was above average (much better than American) and the flight attendants were cheerful professional and happy to help with a smile unlike the surly overweight lazy tenured FAs on most U.S. legacy carriers.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,14th January 2015,4,5,0,UnitedStates,8,yes,December 22nd 2014. MSP-JFK-EZE-FTE. Flew Club Condor. Others in our party of 5 flew coach. We had the full Monty flying Aerolineas. But the staff handled us well. Flight out left on time but no accommodations for Sky Priority passengers. Charge the gate at JFK was more like it. The food was very good. Service is prompt in that every flight attendant worked to get the job done so they could disappear. We liked how they gave us 3 options for our meals. The ice cream for desert and/or cheese plate were fantastic. And it is true they don't offer mixed drinks. For water they gave us a bottle for the over night flight. Breakfast was again very prompt well presented and the crew when prompted did go the extra step. On the return our child's vegetarian meal was missing. The crew promptly reviewed the menu and told us additional items we could choose from. For the return our flight was changed to add a stop at BRC. At which time we were notified our return to JFK was delayed from 11 pm to 6 am. Sky Priority line did nothing to help us here. We had to suffer with the rest. However they did rebook our last segment with Delta for us and effectively communicated to the crew in JFK to assist us and they did! They offered us a hotel and dinner in EZE. As we missed our JFK connection back to MSP they put us up in NYC and paid for dinner there as well. We turned down the offer for the hotel room in EZE and were able to sleep in the Club Condor Lounge. This is easily better than most First Class Lounges I have seen. Aerolineas in my opinion did much more than Delta United or American would have done for us. Our kids got to spend time touring NYC for the night. Our only downside was the plane could have been cleaner. Sad for a new A330-200. Here the domestic carriers do a better job. For the price we paid on for the ticket and what we got it was well worth it.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,26th August 2014,1,2,0,UnitedStates,2,no,I flew MIA-EZE-MIA round trip on Aerolineas Argentinas (AeroA) December 24 2013 returning January 7 2014. I bought the ticket online but their website is not set up to allow you to select your seat. So I called their 800 number in the US. I called for 3 days several times each day before someone answered the phone. This agent's English was so bad it took 20 minutes to select my seats. EZE airport check-in at Buenos Aires is chaos. On AeroA all passengers for the MIA flight stood in a single line to be checked-in for only that flight. The same for other flights. We found this out by asking other passengers what to do as there were no AeroA employees or announcement boards present. There were long long lines of passengers snaking through the terminal. Check-in was so slow we were concerned we would miss our flight even though we arrived 2 hours early. It didn't matter though because our flight was delayed 3 hours on a crystal-clear morning. When we arrived at MIA 3 hours late the AeroA gate agents had gone home and there was no one to help us with rebooking our connections to Chicago. The planes both ways were run-down and old on the inside. On the way down a ceiling panel rattled the entire 9 hours. The entertainment system did not work either direction. The flight attendants only appeared 4 times in 9 hours: to serve drinks after takeoff to serve and collect dinner serve and collect breakfast and hand out immigration and customs forms. My advice: 1) Do not fly Aerolineas Argentinas for any reason even if you have to change your travel plans to avoid them or pay more on another airline. 2) If you are unlucky enough to use them and have to fly out of Buenos Aires EZE airport arrive 3 hours early and prepare for the slowest and most disorganized check-in procedure you have ever experienced. 3) If you do not speak Spanish then you will receive only limited customer service on the phone and their web site is primitive. 4) Prepare yourself for old tatty airplanes with no working entertainment system and largely-invisible flight attendants.,,2,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,3b320176-adb7-49f9-be77-306976758b91

The service and the London office became so bad that it was almost impossible to buy a ticket. When Air Algerie was the only airline flying to Algeria people had to travel to London to buy their tickets. In the last few years more European airlines started to fly to Algeria. A lot of Algerians living in the UK prefer to fly Algeria via a connecting flight (Rome Milan and Paris) than flying with Air Algerie. The price of the ticket was in most cases more expensive. More recently BA started flying to Algiers from London and this provide us an alternative option. My family and most of our friends fly with BA with travelling to London.

Two options are for the breakfast time. The whole experience with the catering was horrible. From the presentation to the quality the food did not respond to a business class. Do not expect to have any cocktails since they only have wine beer and whisky. The dessert was a piece of rock (ice cream) and we received hard croissant and bread in our breakfast.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,17th March 2014,1,3,0,Australia,,no,SYD-EZE on 29/10/2013 and returned EZE-SYD on 22/01/2014. The check-in at Sydney was slow and inefficient. There is no online check-in option for this flight and no seats are allocated prior to check-in so though you should only need to be there 2/3 hours before for an international flight I actually was told to get there 4 hours before just to get a decent seat and even then I queued for nearly an hour to check-in. Boarding was smooth and uneventful. The plane was clean but old. The in-flight entertainment system is horrendous. Considering this is a 15 hour direct flight there is no seat-back entertainment system. There is one large monitor at the front of the cabin and a few smaller ones spaces sporadically. The picture quality is terrible obviously no option to select subtitles if you are not a Spanish speaker. The movies were the same two films on repeat for the 15 hours. Nothing else. The food was adequate though the ran out of some food options leaving my companion to eat vegetarian or nothing else. Obviously the wine is good - it's Argentinean - but the drinks are just served with meals. If you press your call button it is ignored and switched off. I gave up trying to get some water. Breakfast was terrible none of it was edible. Flying back EZE-SYD was not much better. Check-in was a little easier and fortunately this time I managed to get a window seat. Upon boarding I discovered the plane was not full so I had two seats to myself. The only good thing to happen on this flight. The food was just as bad the availability or lack thereof of drinks was the same as before. The toilets were filthy and were obviously not checked or cleaned during the flight. The call-buttons were again ignored. The entertainment system was the same again this time they showed two English language films with Spanish subtitles a slight improvement but still the same on repeat for 15 hours. I would not recommend Aerolineas economy to anyone.,,4,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,feff09ed-883f-4c71-9ece-2739957d56dc

No allocated seating carry your own suitcase to the porters on the runway cabin crew never smile or ask if you are okay. Baggage allowance for different people. The only positive comment is they serve relatively hot food. What saddens me more than anything is the fact that the flight is so short it doesn't take alot to make it a good flight!

My ticket was purchased in the UK through an independent travel broker. No problems there but the ticket was not available for collection when I arrived to check-in at Heathrow. The incompetent Air Algerie rep then took one hour to sort this problem out. To add insult to injury I was flying business class but did not get to see the lounge or do any shopping as the check-in desk had closed by the the time my problem had been resolved. Business class on Air Algerie is a joke. The only additional privilege I could see was an extra four inches of leg room. The interior of the aircraft was shabby the upholstery was dirty and there was even old food and hair in the table stowage area. The food was ok and the service was relatively attentive but I couldn't help but think that it was all a bit too much of an effort for the staff. Come on Air Algerie. Get a grip on your customer service priorities refurbish the aircraft change the menu provide service with a smile - and keep the cabin clean!,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,956be72c-7578-4cc3-89bf-c73731fb0f86

I always leave Montreal or Toronto for some European city and then connect with Air Algerie to Algiers. I also use Air Algerie domestically when i arrive to fly Algiers-Annaba. Flying with them every two years has given me the privilege of seeing the airline grow and IMPROVE. The food is great and plentiful even on the 2h flights from Paris and Frankfurt and the 1h30min. flights from Casablanca. Most other airlines don't even offer HOT meals on such short flights. I find their planes to be quite nice and they are trying to improve them. They phased out the 727s and 732s leaving only the newest and best also adding to it the Airbus 332s. The extension of the International terminal at Algiers gives you a more comfortable and modern lounge/check-in area and hopefully with the completion of the new terminal it will be even better. I find their only problem to be frequent delays. Other than that good service and good planes.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,dc1defd8-cef2-4c60-8dc3-e20d2ee72acf
,Air Algerie,,,24th June 2005,0,0,0,,,no,Lyon to Annaba on Air Algerie yesterday. My father who lives in Annaba flies Air Algerie regularly on work and is absolutely fed up with the airline. At Lyon one corner had been allocated for Air Algerie check-in. It seems even the airport authorities have given up on that corner. A good amount of chaos. In the line before the immigration gate few Algerians broke the wire cordon jumped in and broke the queue in spite of being reprimanded by airport officials. Boarding was disorganized with no priority boarding for business class or for the elderly. Upon entering the plane I discovered that seat numbers meant nothing. My seat was occupied and the FA politely told me I could sit anywhere! Food was horrible. They ran out of water bottles and started serving water in glasses poured out at the back of the aircraft. The water had a fair amount of salt in it. Upon landing at Annaba it took us over an hour to get out of the chaotic airport despite having cleared immigration in 10 minutes. Basically the bags took that long to come out and this when the Lyon flight was the only flight that arrived at the airport that time...when we landed there was not a single aircraft other than ours (domestic or international!!),,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,327f88c2-253a-4217-9e99-055b1dc20a39

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,14th January 2014,1,3,0,UnitedStates,,no,On Dec 18th we left Miami at 7 pm for Buenos Aires. Average flight nothing special. Arrived in Buenos Aires at 5.30 am and went to our assigned gate at the domestic terminal. We were booked on Flight 1880 to Ushuaia that was to leave at 7.45 am (12/19/13) giving 30 hours to catch our 3pm (12/20/13) Antarctic cruise. Fl 1880 was postponed to 8.50 then to 10.30 without explanation. Then told the flight would leave at 3 pm. The flight didn't leave at 3.00 we were then told 8.30pm. What happened at 8.30 pm the postponed time for the scheduled flight is something out of a movie. We were never told that the flight was cancelled we were just told the flight would not be taking off. 2 hours later we were transported by bus out to the tarmac to board our plane to Ushuaia. After stopping at Trelow and taking on more passengers we were scheduled to arrive in Ushuaia about 2 am on 12/20. Landed at a small airport. The captain then for the first time announced that we were in El Calafete instead of Ushuaia. In the early morning hours of the 20th we are waiting in an unscheduled airport not knowing when or if we would arrive in Ushuaia. 2 hours later we board a plane and much to our relief we arrived in Ushuaia at 6am. Needless to say we did arrive at our cruise on time but we had one change of clothes to last us a whole 8 day cruise. We were never offered an explanation for the postponed and cancelled flights and then were diverted to a different airport without warning or explanation.

The airport security is top notch. The food served onboard is good for medium range flights. Contrary to what some people say Air Algerie does allocate seats like other airlines but it is true that some passengers seem to not take that into account which tends to stress the staff into attitudes that are not very friendly during the first 15mns of boarding. Air Algerie has seen a huge improvement in service with the introduction of new planes.

I can say with confidence that both security at airport and food during the flight are the best in the world. The Fleet maybe a little old but the level of maintenance carried out on the planes must be very high. The service provided by the crew is probably poor but I can assure you that the worst of Air-Algerie is the quality of the passengers. Everyone thinks the plane is his or her so he/she can seat anywhere smoke whenever they are pleased take overweighed hand luggage and use their mobile phones during the flight.

,Air Algerie,,,13th August 2004,0,0,0,,,no,My wife and I travel regularly between West Africa and Europe and about a year ago we decided to try Air Algerie to avoid the burden of Air France's unpleasant staff and ridiculously low checked baggage weight limits (economy: 23 kgs!). We were surprised to enjoy a relatively pleasant experience with Air Algerie (Y class) flying recent aircraft (738 and 735s) with acceptable delays (~15-30mns) and fast connections in Algiers on both legs for about half the cost of the AF ticket. The only negative side was a cold uncomfortable transit room in Algiers airport on the outbound flight. On that leg travel time incl. connection was shorter than that of AF. Given the above plus the quality and quantity of food served onboard highlighted by others I consider Air Algerie a fair alternative to Air France on Europe-West Africa routes.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,0798a988-d3ee-4fa8-8144-6ac4e18cf010

For the delays I think is problem of security which is taken really seriously by Algerian authorities and also because there are simply not enough parking place at Algiers Airport which will be resolved with the new airport.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,7b030256-60cb-4454-aead-7ac7ff020048

The flight attendant explained they did not serve whisky until after lunch and that that she did not have any whisky in her cart. She did not have the Shiraz wine that they listed on their menu either so I settled for whichever red wine she could give me. Lunch was mediocre and immediately after the service all flight attendant disappeared for about 7 hours until they brought the ""snack"". Not even a glass of water throughout the flight.

,Air Algerie,,,24th May 2003,0,0,0,,,no,I fly Air Algerie on a regular basis - they are habitually late because of security. For instance when departing Algiers all passengers must identify their luggage which is laid out on the tarmac prior to boarding the aircraft. For this I have no problem. The latest I have ever been leaving Algiers is 45 minutes. It gives me ample time to catch any connecting flights to my next destination. The other reason why they are quite often delayed flying back to Algiers is because there are simply not enough parking spots at the Airport in for incoming flights therefore they wait in Paris Rome Frankfurt etc until a spot can be allocated for the aircraft. The crew is always more than accommodating with refreshments and anything they can do to assist with comfort. They have eliminated smoking on the flights but some people still light up. When this happens they tell the person to put out the cigarette and if the person refuses they are told that should they refuse to extinguish the cigarette - then once they arrivedat the destination the local authorities will be contacted this usually takes care of the problem.,,0,0,air-algerie,Air Algerie customer review,,,0,0,99791199-8adb-42fe-bf09-c1ad78b6dce3

They were award tickets through Sky Team (Delta) points.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,22nd November 2013,0,2,0,UnitedStates,,no,I've flown this airline 12 times. Something bad has happened every single time. Aerolineas Argentinas has a near-monopoly in many Argentinean markets which is very unfortunate. On my most recent trip the flight schedules were changed an astounding 6 times within 3 months of departure with the final one being a cancellation of my flight and a new departure from a different airport. Once you do have an actual confirmed flight the chances of it leaving on time are close to zero.

Cons: Seats are old and sometimes broken. Food is average they serve just 2 meals in a long flight so take some with you during the flight. Old airplane and does not have entertainment system.

Mixed experience first flight left at 2.40am from Rio to Buenos Aires on an Austral Embraer 190 and due to heavy turbulence there was no inflight service whatsoever on the 3 hour flight no apologies at all from the crew which I found rude. Short hops from BA to Montevideo and back uneventful. The return legs were better. Flights left and arrived on time crews on both Embraer 190 (Austral) and B737 did their job well.

No entertainment other than outdated TV hanging from ceiling distorted picture and mainly in another language that could not understand. Seat in front of me was broken and was on a constant lean. The staff or should I say lack of it spent more time talking to one another or reading a magazine than attending to the passengers. The flight home was no better - it might of been cheaper but had I known what they were like I would of gladly paid the extra and flew with Qantas.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,5th November 2013,1,2,0,Australia,1,no,By far the worst airline I have flown. Flew Sydney to Buenos Aires in a plane that looked like it was from the 60's. It was filthy on the outside and inside was even worse. When I opened my blanket on the plane it smelt. The staff were almost non existent during the entire flight.

Great value for money if you don't have high expectations of the airline in the first place. Flight to BA was fine. No delays and food ok.

Have to say was very surprised on the outbound flight as the crew were very nice and attentive the food was good and the ""new"" business seat OK. The inflight entertainment was the flight map since nothing else worked. The cabin was tatty but clean so all in all ok marks for that. The return on the other hand lived up to everything I have read. This crew would put to shame any US crew when it comes to sitting in the galley doing nothing. Food was terrible and yep got a thimbleful of wine. Glad it was overnight so I got to try and sleep but that was hard given the number of families that the pilot FA's and gate agents brought up to the business cabin.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Premium Economy,,20th October 2013,1,1,0,Australia,,no,Arrived at the airport at 4.30am supposed to fly to Sydney at 8.30am had a connecting flight to Melbourne from Sydney. Flight was delayed until 9.30am then until 1pm didn't leave Argentina until 2.30pm now stuck in Sydney airport on the floor because Qantas have a cut off time on the weekend and Aerolineas Argentinas managed to get me after the cut off time when I was supposed to be here at 5pm! If there is another airline out from Argentina I would take that instead if this one. Even the flight entertainment is poor. You don't get your own screen so you're stuck watching these old tvs that the worst picture known to man. The only good thing was that I got 2 seats to myself. Probably because everyone knows not to fly with them!,,1,3,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,1,0,3af4de71-68ca-4b08-8d3e-10bd051cc2e2
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,2nd October 2013,1,5,0,Australia,8,yes,We flew return to Buenos Aries from Sydney. Condor class was not a lot more expensive than economy given the 16 hour trip. We had plenty of leg room and the food was excellent. The seats and everything seemed to function. Flights were on time and our luggage arrived on the carousel. Check in was speedy. As other reviewers noted the planes are old so I needed a cushion for lumbar support and we took tablets with books and movies downloaded. This worked very well with excellent picture and sound quality. Staff perhaps could have done more to keep others under control eg a couple immediately behind us watched videos on their laptop with no earplugs so we got the full sound while we were trying to sleep. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the trip.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,e8a6ae54-bde7-4dd4-91a5-7fa5a6f58091

We had no problems with any of the flights. They departed on time and our luggage arrived safely. Check in was super fast. The planes were reasonably modern and staff service OK. Food consisted of a snack box which was adequate for a short haul flight. While the flights were expensive prices were reduced considerably by purchasing discounted tickets before we arrived in Argentina. Given the reviews we were pleasantly surprised with the flights or perhaps we were just lucky. There was certainly nothing wrong with them.,,4,0,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,736fa3fc-01c0-46e1-97fb-b08a65b1f89a

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2013,1,4,0,Australia,7,yes,Sydney to Buenos Aires return. Plane out very old and needing internal maintenance. A couple of overhead locker taped up with do not use notices. The TV that I could see did not work. Didn't see the cabin staff smile once. Seats are tired and sagged. Food was good though I had taken bits to eat but the meal we got was good. No in flight services after the meal but drinks and snacks available. On the way back we were at the airport 23 hours before the flight (due to our connection) and requested a row of seats together. Couldn't check us in as check-in opened 3 hours before. When we checked in 3 hours before we were sat in different seats over the plane and told there were no available seats! Managed to get the children sat together and myself and my wife were in separate seats. On return the plane was in a slightly better shape a little newer. The TV was working but lost the red so some interesting colours for the films. Reasonable films and one channel in English. Food was again good. The cabin staff were great. All smiles and they came round every couple of hours with water/juice.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,10th July 2013,1,2,0,Australia,,no,Flew home from Sao Paulo to Sydney in January 2012. 4-hour delay departing change of aircraft at Buenos Aires resulted in an 8-hour delay. Passengers asked to wait in a lounge then abandoned. No staff for several hours. After 6 hours we got a rapid announcement in Spanish. Passengers were English-speaking Australians! BA to Auckland was unpleasant. TV screens were not working well. The girl in front of me ordered a vegetarian meal as did I. Of course they did not have it. They never have vegetarian meals. The hostess actually argued with the girl and told her that it was her fault that the meal was not ordered. The final insult was a 4-hour delay at Auckland Airport.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th June 2013,3,4,0,Australia,8,yes,Flight between Sydney and Buenos Aires was pretty good. Staff were friendly and spoke English! Once I arrived in Buenos Aires this changed. Next flight was to Sao Paulo but they refer to it as San Pablo. This flight was delayed a couple of hours but the staff were pretty good. Once I arrived at Sao Paulo the service was not as good but still okay. Staff seem tired and run down. Staff at the gate could not decide which gate the airline was at. If your a person of English speaking background and don't know much Spanish or Portuguese it pays to find someone to translate. I flew to Curitiba and the service was excellent and staff were friendly! We arrived on time. On the way back my flight got delayed and was going to be diverted from Buenos Aires due to poor weather.

Before buying the ticket I researched the airline so I would know what to expect. It exceeded my expectations. Got the above ticket for AUD 3700.00 The only sectors in economy were AEP-FTE-AEP. Of the 7 flights all left on time except one and that only was delayed 20 mins. Food was great service was great. If you wanted anything they were more than obliging to help.

I wasn't able to eat the food served because my agent (nothing to do with AA) forgot to send the request for vegetarian food (must be done when the booking is made) and they didn't have much options for non- meat eaters.

No apology from staff for not having a place for me and my son to return to Sydney. I also lost time at work which I was not paid for.

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,28th April 2013,1,1,0,Australia,,no,We flew Club Condor (business class) from Sydney to Buenos Aires and then on Austral (regional airline) to Rio and back. It is obviously an airline of a country in economic crisis. Aircraft used on the SYD-EZE-SYD route is like stepping back into 1975. Big old recliner seats (not flat) 3 scheduled movies on a continuous loop. No laptop power etc. The service is very basic to other carriers. AA club condor service is similar to what's offered in economy on other carriers. This is an extremely long flight close to 16 hours yet AA still doesn't use their brand new Airbus with lie flat beds I believe this is used to Madrid and back for obvious reasons. The crew on all sectors didn't really want to be there. EZE-SYD is one of the longest flights in the world made even longer by the aircraft and the service. We would choose to go with Qantas/LAN via Santiago in future trips to South America.,,1,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,88646296-8d16-4935-b54a-7b58993bf697

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Business Class,,21st April 2013,2,4,0,Australia,7,yes,Sydney to Buenos Aires and return in April 2013 in business class. Yes it's an old aircraft and the seats are only the old lounge chair type. Also the entertainment is limited. But they are replacing the A340-200 with a 300 series later this year so that should solve these problems. The business class check in was performed meticulously and lounge access given at both airports. Priority boarding was strictly enforced. The on board service was friendly and very personal. My coat snatched away and hung up as soon as I arrived at my seat. The catering was adequate and appropriate for such a long flight. Main courses were presented and served from a trolley in the cabin. They did offer fast track on departure but not on arrival. Still the airport in Sydney was so quiet it was unnecessary. One small criticism is that the Sydney arrival cards were in Spanish. Not easy for us Aussies. The price paid for the ticket represented unbelievable value. I'd fly the again without hesitation.,,2,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,555ab43d-39d9-435d-9c0d-64082e06d687

Food out on the night flight was okay but could only have 1 half glass of wine. Trip back again no online check in be at the airport 3 hrs before but had to stand around for 50 mins before any processing began. Was told 3 weeks before the flight it would be delayed 20 mins - got to the Airport it was shown to be 1 hr delay but eventually the 8.30am flight departed at 11am. Food was dreadful but this time could get more than 1 glass of wine. There was no explanation as to why the flight was delayed. Experienced similar on Austral (a subsidiary) had to be there 2hrs before and it still departed late. Iguazu-Salta cheese sandwich offered which was thicker - the bread or cheese?

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,3rd April 2013,1,1,0,Australia,1,no,My husband and I recently travelled on Aerolineas Argentinas from Buenos Aires. There was no facility for web check-in or to have our seats pre-allocated prior to check-in. We arrived more than 2 hours prior to the flight to be told that the only way we could sit together was to take 2 middle seats in the centre row of the plane. The A340 has a 2-4-2 configuration. In such a configuration 50% of the seats are aisle seats. However it appeared that almost all had been pre-allocated prior to the ordinary check-in opening. In the end we were offered an aisle and a middle seat in the very back row. It is time that Aerolineas recognized that families are entitled to expect to sit together on long haul flights without having to take the worst seats on the plane. Other airlines manage to do this why cant Aerolineas?,,2,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,03985dd5-cd2c-4f69-8066-5259e34e65bf

The seats are rock hard but with better leg room than many. No on-line check-in or seat selection. No early bag drops on transfers meaning I had to wait for 3 hours at EZE before passing through immigration. (At 2am.) No in-seat entertainment and the two in-cabin screens-and sound - only worked part of the time. The same low res movies shown in both directions. The food coming back from EZE was the worst I have ever had on an airline with a tiny dried-up croissant tiny hard roll and insipid yoghurt offered as breakfast and pasta with a teaspoon of tasteless tomato sauce for lunch. I could not even get any pepper when I asked. Red wine was good though. Food out of SYD was much better. Excellent new terminal C at Ezeiza and 57 nice new aircraft in Argentina - pity these advancements don't extend to the Australian part of the operation.

Plane full with lots of legroom for 18 year old plane. Food was ok with snacks and drinks which you had to get yourself. Great views of the Antarctica if only the staff would let us see most of the flight the shades were kept down. Bring your own entertainment but they did show a couple of movies.

The plane seemed very old. Inflight entertainment poor quality TV and screen. Food was just bearable. The only flight that left on time was the one out of Sydney. First and last time flying with AA. Delay in BA to Santiago due to not wanting to fuel the plane in the rain. Delay from Santiago to BA no idea why. A supposed delay of 22 mins which turned into just over an hour from BA to Sydney which caused me to miss my connecting flight. So overall not happy with the experience.

The outward flight left early from Sydney and arrived early in BA. The return flight left 30 minutes late but picked up the time on the way home. On both sectors the service was prompt and efficient. Food and wine was good but not presented as top tier carriers would present. The entertainment system was archaic limited and not on demand. This is well documented by other reviewers. We took kindles and an ipad and once we watched one movie we were quite happy to read and play. Views of the Antarctic ice sheet also kept us amused on the way home. Seats are old style business but we did sleep nearly 9 hours on the night flight on the way over. If this one experience is the norm for this sector I would recommend the business class offering given the price advantages - you can overcome the most significant weakness (IFE) by buying movies for your ipad and you can buy plenty for the saving in air fares.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,acef94ec-f687-47d6-bee2-b6d9c96545b5
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,16th September 2012,0,1,0,Australia,2,no,A340-200 SYD-EZE. I felt like I have stepped back in time when flying with this airline. They need to update the seating in the older aircraft. Very little attention is paid to safety carry on bags were left unsecured on seats during take-off. Seats were broken and reclined without pushing the recline button. Despite the seats being broken passengers were permitted to use them. There was no personal entertainment and it is strictly bring your own. Before and soon after take-off the cabin became very cold. Approx 1 hour into the flight the seat belt sign was turned off for the first time shortly after staff delivered the food. There was no choice of meal (chicken or red meat) let alone a vegetarian selection. After dinner the food trays were collected and the lights turned off and all passengers were expected to sleep. The staff must have also turned up the temperature as the aircraft cabin became very hot and stuffy. The flight was 14 hours and passengers were expected to sleep 10 of those hours. Approx 2 hours before landing the lights were turned back on we were fed again and the cabin became very cold. Trays removed just in time to land in Buenos Aires. Staff were seen at the rear of the craft playing on laptops and not offering any drink runs to passengers.,,3,3,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,438fa14e-663d-46ae-8692-cd45367a843f
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,6th September 2012,1,3,0,Australia,4,no,FCO (Rome) - EZE. The lack of IFE was an obvious flaw but my tablet computer lasted the whole journey so it was ok. The food wasn't great but the white wine was superb. Staff were very nice and even though I was Australian flying from Italy they all spoke perfect English. Flying Aerolineas was very much what it was like to fly domestic in Australia in the nineties - not great but bearable.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,3,0,12752993-0d65-4b59-864e-cbe3e0ae068f
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,4th September 2012,0,3,0,Australia,7,yes,I recently flew with AR on the new direct SYD-EZE service. I must say after reading the previous reviews here that I was pleasantly surprised. Flights were on time cabin crew were friendly (more so on the return leg) seat pitch in economy was actually very good cabin was clean and tidy. Yes there are no back of seat entertainment screens but for the price you cannot expect 5 star services. If being entertained is an issue bring your ipad or a good book! Food was OK. On the return flight after dinner service sandwiches were self- served from the rear of the cabin and it would be beneficial here to at least offer a selection (for us veggies rather than the ubiquitous ham and cheese). Overall the flight was as good as any for the price – in fact the worst part was actually going through customs at EZE  which took well over an hour. I thought I had landed at LAX! Overall I would recommend this airline if you are after a well-priced airfare – just don't expect 5 star amenities services for a 3 star price.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,a2f2b30b-a5c7-458e-9e44-e9e5f453b33a
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th August 2012,1,4,0,Australia,4,no,I flew from Lima to Sydney via Buenos Aires. My flight in Buenos Aires was delayed 1.5 hours but Aerolineas did not communicate with us at all! They announced a couple of times in Spanish thank you for your patience but that was it. Finally when we boarded it took another hour to take off! The people on my flight were complaining of the terrible service they had already experienced with Aerolineas. When I arrived in Sydney I had missed my connecting flight and so had half of the passengers I was with. We all had to pay for new tickets to our next destination which cost me $170 to Melbourne! Their entertainment was poor they played the same movie over and over and when passengers asked for help staff ignored them! Pretty bad service is an understatement.,,3,2,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,aaff9af2-5bf3-4b10-b71c-c37372546730
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,28th August 2012,2,3,0,Australia,8,yes,SYD-EZE-SYD. Plane is an older A340-200 - without personal IFE - just a main screen. Economy class seats were generously sized and I was offered an emergency exit seat from SYD-EZE. EZE-SYD was a standard economy class seat. Plane departed on time from SYD-EZE and again EZE-SYD. Staff friendly and always walking around. Food was edible but there wasn't much of it. A small self-serve bar in the galley provided water and snacks during the flight. Both flights the plane landed on time and overall was a pleasant experience. Despite being limited in features I got from SYD to EZE and back cheaply comfortably and if you bring your iPad/iPod you'll be entertained. If there was no price difference between AR and LAN/Qantas etc. consider going on the latter. But AR isn't a bad airline provided you've got some personal entertainment on the long 13-15 hour flights. One final point - the AR website is incredibly hard to navigate and use. Calls to their SYD call centre go without answer.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,4,0,8a1000d9-b70c-4d58-a5f8-020c8ac5df4a

I found the service better and aircraft was old but with more legroom. The crew was also good and trying to help passengers as it was a long flight of 16 hrs. Food was OK and they should improve their entertainment service. Overall we enjoyed and would definitely go again.,,4,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,6e50286e-0617-49b1-900a-0d643ad7c614
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,20th August 2012,0,1,0,Australia,1,no,They delayed my flight by 3 days and were incredibly rude and unapologetic. I was supposed to fly from Sydney to Buenos Aires via Auckland and Santiago. I turned up at the check in counter in Sydney and was told the flight would be delayed because the plane hadn't arrived yet from Auckland but it would only be a couple of hours. When I returned they said the plane would not be arriving after all and that we would not leave Sydney for another two days. Staff were rude and unhelpful and once we were taken to the accommodation we didn't hear from them again except for a piece of paper under the hotel door telling us to be ready at 5am. After two days we went back to airport there was no staff member there and we had to go from counter to counter trying to find out which flight we were on. After finally checking in and going through immigration we were at the boarding gate when we were told that we would not be flying out after all as there was no plane to meet us in Auckland. No staff representative. I ended up changing to LAN Chile who were excellent.,,0,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,1,0,6cb672b3-fa02-4202-8a6c-ff5f4fa9e9b2
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,26th July 2012,1,3,0,Australia,6,yes,Return flight (Sydney-Buenos Aires). The fare was really competitive. Flight left on time from Sydney to Buenos Aires. Food was below average (Fish and rice for dinner and very small sandwiches for breakfast and middle snack). On board entertainment is the worst entertainment I have witnessed. Flight attendants were nice. On my way back flight delayed 30 minutes. Food was good (Chicken and rice for lunch. Croissant tea and fruits for breakfast and small chicken sandwich for middle snack). On board entertainment was better than the first flight. Pros: Excellent price - On time flights - Friendly staff. Cons: No personal entertainment nor good screens - Bad food on first flight - Staff didn't allow me to use my iphone in flight mode - not very tidy (though not dirty).,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,5,0,0d51b434-364c-4d68-b21c-2d076d1de482

,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2012,1,2,0,NewZealand,4,no,Flew AKL-EZE/AEP-GIG-AEP/EZE-AKL. Both long-haul legs were close to being on time but the baggage wait in BA was around 40 min (thus missed the transfer bus to the other airport in BA and had to get a cab). Upon arrival at AEP I was checked-in for the flight to Rio as normal. But 20 min after the schedule boarding time everyone was informed that AR decided to switch the departing airport back to EZE (and this is already at 10pm). So had to re-clear the custom collect our baggage wait for 30 min for the bus take the 1 hour bus ride to the other side of the town re-check in and re-clear the custom at EZE (which took 1 hour). Finally landed in Rio at 3.30am 4 hours late. No compensation was offered whatsoever. The return flights were relatively stress-free. Overall the cabin service was above average but planes are antiquated with no personal entertainment but a leaky roof. Breakfast on the 13 hour long-haul consisted of two pieces of cold bread and a banana. Much cheaper than LAN but definitely not worth the money paid.,,3,4,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,2,0,8796d86c-96e0-4a66-a55f-51903286d6ff
,Aerolineas Argentinas,Economy Class,,15th July 2012,0,1,0,Norway,1,no,Was booked on the flight on the 13th of July from EZE-SYD (which does not go via AKL anymore). I checked- in and everything was confirmed with my seat etc. I was at the airport at 6am for the 8.30am flight. After 1 hour in line I was only half way down the queue. A little bit later other passengers bound for SYD were denied access. The following reason was given: the weather pattern on the route to SYD. Therefore they had to get rid of weight to have a lighter aircraft to make it the entire way. Later we learnt that they had given freight/cargo priority and consequently 80 of us were stranded with the next flight due 3 days later which only had 40 free spots. The employees only spoke Spanish which was hard for people who didn't know the language. Lots of ideas were thrown around but evidently the flight left without us. I had checked the flight the days/weeks before I was due to fly it and noticed that the flight always left EZE delayed by 1-2 hours which could be for similar reasons. Maybe they should go back to flying via AKL to be able to accept all the paid passengers. Their compensation was not good either and I (and several others) decided we wanted a full refund.,,0,1,aerolineas-argentinas,Aerolineas Argentinas customer review,,,0,0,241e5fd2-2ec2-41b5-8915-b362f8bb502c

Long story short we stayed overnight at the airport (with 5 children) and the next day we were flown to Corrientes instead of Resistencia.

We reconfirmed this at check-in but upon entering the aircraft we discovered this not to be the case and we were not even sitting together. On the first flight the audio did not work on my seat and on the other the visuals were running without audio. Staff tried to speak English but generally had a poor capability so communicating in Spanish was more effective. Some staff were unfriendly and all staff disappeared for about five hours after serving the meal on leaving BA. Snacks and drinks were available in the galley areas but this was not announced so passengers only found out about it through diffusion.

There was a single screen for entertainment but no headphones were passed out during one flight until the movie had run! The movies were old. The food was decidedly average. The plane fittings appeared old - my seat bottom was entirely loose from its frame and two of the bathroom doors I used wouldn't close properly. The toilets were not serviced at all during the long 12 hours flights so they were pretty horrible by the end.

,Air Bagan,,,20th March 2007,0,0,0,,,no,Air Bagan may be Myanmar’s fastest growing airline even having international ambitions but we had the experience they are not really that well organized internally. We booked a number of domestic flights with them and tickets were written out with OK status on February the 12th when we picked them up in their downtown Yangon office. A week later when we checked in at Nyaung U for a NYE-HEH flight Air Bagan staff told us flight AKY-RGN we booked was cancelled and we had to contact Air Bagan in Taunggyi once we arrived in HEH to arrange alternative travel. After arrival in HEH we contacted Air Bagan in Taunggyi who told us no flights were cancelled. We asked them to verify this again and later that night Air Bagan called us we didn’t have to worry and the AKY-RGN flight would certainly fly. A few days later we flew HEH-SNW and as we had a reservation to fly SNW-AKY the next day we once more checked with Air Bagan at SNW airport on the AKY-RGN flight. We now were told AKY-RGN was cancelled as AKY airport would be closed ‘for maintenance’ for several days! The SNW-AKY we booked would still operate but as return flights for the next days would not operate we of course decided to cancel SNW-AKY. Air Bagan didn’t seem to understand why we didn’t want to fly SNW-AKY. Having no return flight from AKY didn’t seem to be an issue for them and they suggested us to buy a full fare SNW-RGN flight. They agreed to refund us the cancelled flights (after paying a cancellation fee) but refund could only be made in the Air Bagan office where we paid the tickets! This would mean we had to go back to downtown Yangon what we hadn’t planned into our travel schedule anymore. After several discussions with Air Bagan staff in SNW and with the help of our hotel manager in Ngapali the next day when we showed up at SNW airport for the SNW-RGN flight local Air Bagan staff appeared to be very helpful and tickets were paid back at SNW airport and fare for the SNW-RGN was ‘Town Office’ and not ‘Published’ full fare. We were very pleased local Air Bagan staff in SNW understood the issue and willing as well to refund us but next time I book a flight with them I’ll think twice.,,0,0,air-bagan,Air Bagan customer review,,,0,0,f3f96357-f9a7-44b6-b0eb-0c562818b953

A350-900,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Business Class,Jan-22,30th January 2022,5,4,2,UnitedKingdom,5,no,"Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.

And with my name I can’t have my voucher I don’t know why for my ticket that put error.  I’ve been fighting during almost 10 months to have my refund.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,Apr-20,2nd November 2020,0,0,0,Australia,1,no,"My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",Rome to Tokyo via Moscow,0,0,aeroflot-russian-airlines,The customer service was extremely poor,Couple Leisure,Not Verified,1,0,eb953463-76e6-4346-bac3-537c2bf732e3

The check-in process was prompt as was the departure. It was reassuring to see that security was taken seriously and several checks took place before boarding. My only gripe was that no provision was made for elderly people, disabled passengers and those with babies to have priority boarding. Some passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage while others were strictly controlled. A lack of consistency was apparent. The cabin crew were efficient. Service was based on those who preordered items online. The staff then performed a purchase trolley service. This service was well organised. Full credit to the staff. The seats were comfortable and a route map was used on this A320.

Embraer 170,Air Burkina,Economy Class,Nov-18,11th February 2019,0,4,1,Israel,4,no,"I was booked to fly non stop from Abidjan to Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) with Air Burkina. Their website was surprisingly easy to maneuver ,and in a few minutes my ETKT was issued. I guess i was smart to ask the Concierge at my hotel in Abidjan to confirm my flight the day before.Air Burkina had my email,but no notices whatsoever re the dramatic change.To my unpleasant surprise he was told my flight was cancelled, and i was rebooked on a different flight at 0800 rather than 1115. I was at the check in counters at 0600 per the instructions of the reservation office in Abidjan. Im sure the Concierge understood well the new information he received from Air Burkina's office. To my unpleasant surprise i was refused to be checked in and was told to wait, as 'there is a problem with my ticket'. I waited patiently till ALL passengers were checked in, and then i was told by hand signs (No English spoken by the check in supervisor) that the flight is full, and to go and see the agents at Air Burkina's office in the terminal. There i was told by an agent that I'm booked on a different flight at 3pm. I insisted that i had a seat on the early morning flight, as i trusted the information i got from the hotel in the city. I was promised i had a seat at 3pm,but already i had my doubts at that point. I asked why they didn't accept me on the 0800 flight as they cancelled my original flight, and even if i had no reservation per their version, i thought i was entitled to standby for the morning flight. ""No"" was the answer. Reason: the flight was stopping in Accra where it was going to be filled up 100%. I told the agents that i thank them for their efforts, and i am not going to wait 8 hours at the airport for 'maybe' flying at 3pm. I left their office trying to figure out a way out of Ivory Coast as i had a Business class ticket on Ethiopian from Ouagadougou to Addis Ababa, and hoped Ethiopian Airlines would reissue my ticket to fly from Abidjan to Addis. Suddenly i was approached by the Air Burkina agent, who offered me to pay 'penalty' for a flight change from 3pm to 8 am of 50Euro - I had to pay Air Burkina 50 EURO because THEY cancelled my flight. Amazing! The 100% full flight from Accra excuse was no longer an issue. I decided to pay despite the convoluted business conduct of Air Burkina, so i don't miss my visit to Burkina Faso for 50 Euro. I paid, and quickly was rushed to the aircraft. Out of Accra there were at least 20 empty seats and Business class was 100% empty. So much for correct information. The aircraft was an ex LOT airliner in terrible shape, torn seats, dirty cabin, toilets without toilet paper. Drinks were served from Abidjan to Accra's 30 minute flight,and a hot tasty meal was offered on the 1 hour flight from Accra to Ouagadougou. Quite impressive service.

First my mother received an itinerary and a payment confirmation only to arrive at the airport to be told that her ticket was not issued and that she would have to purchase another. She complained about this and Air Botswana tried to calm the situation down stating that she will be reimbursed for the purchase. The second issue was that i had a connecting flight from Johannesburg to Gaborone with air Botswana. My initial flight was from Cape Town. 2hrs before my departure from Cape Town i get informed that the flight from Johannesburg to gabs was cancelled. I was forced to take the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg but to purchase accommodation for the next day for when air Botswana could give me another flight. I was not reimbursed for the expenses incurred. The third issue is the same as the first which happened to my brother who experienced the same issue as my mother. The fourth issue occurred this morning when I arrived at the check im desk after having travelled 300km on road to get to Gaborone Airport I was inform that although I have a payment confirmation from DPO Pay, Air Botswana had still not received any reflected money in their account and thus would have to purchase another ticket from the ticket sales. This resulted in me having to pay all my travel money and borrowing some to purchase this ticket. I am a student and one can only imagine the difficulty this caused.

It has been delayed to 3pm and will land in Joburg at 6pm. Leaving us with 1h35 to catch our flight in Joburg. Quite difficult to do but doable. I wrote to customer service to ask them if it will be ok to have such a short transit time in Joburg, but they never answered me. When we arrived in Maun, we told the Air Botswana representative that we had to register on our flight to Europe because we will not have time to do it. They told us that they will try to. 30 min before departure, we learned by Canadian tourists that the flight had been delayed to 5pm. We ask Air Botswana to book us on another flight for Europe. After long minutes on their back they told us that we were booked on Virgin Atlantic instead of Swiss. It was ok for us even if the transit time would be short (1h20). We only wanted to be in Paris the next morning, so making a stop in Zurich or London wasn't an issue for us. During the flight we asked flight attendants that we will have a short transit time in Joburg and to organize something to make sure we catch our virgin Atlantic flight. We had to ask twice because we made a stop in Gaborone and flight attendants changed. When we arrived a van was there to drive us to the virgin atlantic terminal. Everything seems fine right? Well when we wanted to check in on Virgin Atlantic, the attendants told us that my ticket could not be emitted, leaving my wife alone.

,Air Austral,,,10th August 2004,0,0,0,,,no,I currently live in London and I fly once a year to Reunion for holidays. I use to fly on Air France in classe Alize (Economy Plus) but recently I tried Air Austral for the first time in Classe Loisirs (Economy) and was far more satisfied with the level of customer care in terms of punctuality high food quality and friendly staff. As being part of the Air France Frequence Plus scheme the good news is I can get some qualifying miles and this code-share flight makes my life easy as I don't need to change airport - ie remaining in CDG and not going to Orly. So I would recommend Air Austral in terms of: Comfort: their B777 is modern the seats are more comfortable and you have more space to put your hand luggage in the compartments above your head. Food: even in Classe Loisirs you have a huge plateau and you are really spoilt. Customer care: excellent staff. They provide you with warm towels as you get on board and in the morning. They also pass through at night asking you if you want some water while everyone is asleep. Everything with a smile! Punctuality: both outbound and return flights left on time. Unfortunately I read that Air France will stop this code-share flight with Air Austral and I find this decision very sad. I wish everyone who is part of Frequence Plus loyalty scheme to convince Air France to come back to its decision as the CDG-RUN-CDG must not disappear. Air Austral is the getaway to Reunion via CDG for all European and worldwide customers and you won't be disappointed.

Warning to anyone who is considering flying with them: if you expect even mediocre customer service do yourself a favor and stay away. We were supposed to fly from Maun with Air Botswana to land in Johannesburg landing at 4 pm with a full four hours to spare before our long haul flight back to the US via Delta. When we arrived at the Maun airport chaos had ensued. What appeared to be a huge tour group had the spotlight and despite reaching the front of the line to check in we were completely ignored as the attendants told us they needed to tend to others first. Service was exorbitantly slow as there were only 2 attendants who were hand writing boarding passes. After an hour of waiting we were told the flight was oversold and we would not be getting on. We’re convinced that although we had booked our flights 6 months earlier we were bumped along with about 20 others from the flight in favor of the tour group. You can imagine the hysteria as the majority of the 20 had connecting flights in Johannesburg. The attendants assured us that we would get on another plane that was routed to Cape Town but would first stop in Johannesburg to drop us off by 6 pm. We found this odd but at that point had no other choice. It was only after we boarded the plane that we discovered we were instead going to Gaborone and from there another plane would take us to Johannesburg immediately. When we reached Gaborone the Air Botswana rep was extremely confused why we had arrived and told us we had been lied to and would have to wait another 1.5 hours to take off. Not surprisingly the flight was further delayed so we finally arrived in Jo'burg at 8.30 minutes after our second leg to Atlanta took off. We were extremely upset but told we’d be waitlisted for the next Delta flight out - which unfortunately was not for a full 24 hours. The real kicker? We were told you owe us $650 USD. Still can’t quite comprehend how they had the gall to say this to our faces but at this point nothing surprised us. No reps from either Air Botswana or Delta were available to give us a definitive answer on whether we’d be guaranteed to be on the flight so off we went to a local hotel in hopes of returning the next day to get everything straightened out. The people who work for this airline not only have the poorest customer service skills I have ever witnessed. When we arrived on day 2 to try to check in to Delta we were told we only had a 50/50 shot of getting on the plane. There is one flight per day and subsequent flights were all booked solid. We were beginning to think this nightmare might continue on for days and days. Surely there had to be a carrier going to any city in the US that could accommodate us. There was. Two in fact. However Air Botswana would need to book it for us – and they flat out refused. We were only able to get on the Delta flight thanks to their management; the Air Botswana rep was never to be heard from again.

When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation.

I was connecting with a flight to Europe and if I had known that earlier I could have labelled my bag accordingly and I might have tried to check my bag through the whole way. I felt sorry for the staff as they were polite and tried hard to appease the passengers. They couldn't take the bags for safety reasons which is fair enough. The problem was that they knew this before we boarded the aircraft and chose to tell us once we were aboard. We flew via Gabarone to refuel. Then in Johannesburg a representative met us at the luggage carousel and told us that our bags would arrive tomorrow! At least he was there when our flight arrived and not when the supposed next flight was meant to arrive 2 hours later. However that was a bit of a shock for some of the passengers as Air Botswana must have known this in Maun. He took down all our details and where we wanted our bags sent if we weren't staying in Johannesburg. I honestly didn't expect to see my bag again. Three days later at home in Spain an Air Botswana rep phones me and asks me which airport in Spain I want my bag sent to! Zaragoza is 1.5 hours drive away and the nearest airport. My bag arrived there 2 days later. If any other airline flew between Main and Johannesburg I would try them. I think Air Botswana needs some competition!,,0,0,air-botswana,Air Botswana customer review,,,1,0,4e1df318-fe7e-4b58-9d63-0feb018beb09

They refused to let us go to the gates office to deliver our baggage and they stated that our documents were not legal, the same documents that we have used to register in Brussels, our Moroccan valid passport and valid permanent residents cards. We have even double nationality, as we have the Moroccan and the Dutch nationality.

Why are company employees working so slowly?” I want to ask one more question: ""Why do the tickets indicate only the time of boarding the plane, but there is no time to complete the registration?""

Lady on the check-in counter told me, that there is no delay of the flight, when actually it was a delay for 30 mins.

A320-214,Air Cairo,Economy Class,Oct-22,30th October 2022,0,3,5,CzechRepublic,1,no,"I will forever regret not treating the bad reviews seriously before traveling with Air Cairo. Their flight from Hurghada to Prague turned out to be by far the worst traveling experience of my life. First problems arose when we were notified in Hurghada that our flight was delayed by five hours. I discovered on flightradar24.com that the reason for the delay was the plane having been diverted to Skopje on a flight from Hurghada to Belgrade earlier that day. This was our first warning sign, foreshadowing what was to come next. When we finally took off and headed to Prague, the captain announced that our flight was diverted to Leipzig, Germany due to ""bad weather"" in Prague. The crew also told us that no planes were allowed to land in Prague for this reason whatsoever. When we confronted them with the fact that we were the only plane being diverted, they suddenly changed their story and claimed that our aircraft was not suitable for landing in low visibility. When we proved this to be a lie as well, they changed their story once more and told us that the pilots were inexperienced and therefore not trained for landing in foggy weather. What the real reason for the diversion was and how their side of the story would have developed had we pushed on them further, I have no idea. When we were finally allowed to leave the aircraft in Leipzig, we received no information about future plans whatsoever and the crew simply went to bed. The staff at Leipzig Airport were unable to help us either since the only people who knew at least something about our situation were asleep. At least that is what they said. Furthermore, they denied us access to our check-in luggage in spite of some passengers being in urgent need of their medication. On the plus side, Leipzig Airport provided us with beds and blankets to survive the night, for which we were thankful. Air Cairo, on the other hand, did nothing. The following morning was a disaster as well. A substitute flight from Leipzig to Prague was scheduled first for 5:30am, then for 11:00am. However, we still had no specific information as the airport staff was unable to reach the crew and the management of Air Cairo refused to communicate with us. The airport staff claimed that the only thing for which we were waiting was the crew, who were asleep at the hotel. Yet when the management of Air Cairo finally started answering our questions, they told us that the crew were already waiting at the hotel in their uniforms, not knowing themselves why they were not able to fly. What was the reason for the waiting, then? Were we waiting for the fog in Prague to disappear? We had no idea because no one bothered to tell us. After many hours of stressful waiting, during which we were again given misinformation multiple times and several passengers burst into tears, the crew finally arrived with no further explanation at 12:45pm and we took off at 1:30pm. To sum up, our landing in Prague was delayed by 20 hours. There are, however, two aspects of our situation that are most annoying. Firstly, it was argued that our issues were caused by fog. Yet we were the only plane on that day which had this problem and dozens of other aircraft were perfectly capable of taking off and landing in Prague. The problem was therefore clearly on the side of the airline and their pilots. And secondly, what I consider even more disgraceful was the arrogance with which the airline treated us and all their deception, lies and lack of communication.",Hurghada to Prague,5,1,air-cairo,"deception, lies and lack of communication",Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,a254712b-c1ce-4d5e-95fd-0c8318b9ac2d

Then the situation with covid-19 got really bad and the EU issued a travel ban for all US citizens. I contacted Travel2Be to explain the situation to them and it took them a long time to reply saying that I have one year from the date of original purchase to use my tickets or I would lose them. I then tried to fill out a refund form on Air Caraibes. The site did not work and there was no email or number to contact them. I reply to the cancellation email, once again explaining the situation and asking them if they could extend the ticket to 2021. Their answer was use it by November 2020 or lose them.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,Jun-19,7th August 2019,0,0,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow in June 2019. Worst experience I've had with an airline. My flight from JFK to SVO, was continually delayed by Aeroflot without explanation. Even though the boarding time was never changed, we boarded over an hour late, then were told to get off after 80 minutes sitting on the plane without any sort of communication from Aeroflot staff about what was happening. They eventually claimed that they were trying to solve ""mechanical issues"" with the plane while we continued to sit on the plane. As I later heard airport staff commenting on, I have no idea why they boarded all of the passengers when they had clearly not solved the issue to begin with. To make matters worse, despite the flight taking off from New York (with many American and English-speaking passengers on board), most of the announcements were only made in Russian. After we got off, we were told that we would need to wait for up to 3 more hours to be notified about the status of our flight. We waited for almost 2 more hours before they canceled the flight - but, in fact, they did not admit to canceling the flight - instead, they claimed to have ""delayed"" the flight for a full 24 hours! Many passengers, myself included, were upset and frustrated, but this was not the end of the complete botching of this flight by Aeroflot. They seemed to have no planned response to this scenario. They herded us all upstairs to claim our luggage, and then had us wait in obscenely long lines to check in with two Aeroflot staff members  to claim an updated ticket for the 24-hour-delayed flight and/or a hotel voucher. After already being delayed for hours, we had to wait on these lines for at least an additional 1-2 hours. The worst part of this whole disaster was that Aeroflot claimed that they were not rebooking anyone's flight because the flight had not technically been canceled, it had been delayed (according to them). Most reasonable airlines release tickets once a flight has been canceled (as this one effectively had been, clearly) so that passengers can rebook on other flights, but Aeroflot was able to get around that by ""delaying"" the flight.  The staff that were handing out the new tickets and hotel vouchers were quite rude and displayed no sympathy for customers who had been treated so poorly by the airline already (I understand they were dealing with many angry customers, but they still could have at least apologized on the behalf of the airline, which they did not). Sure enough, even though I had a program in Tel Aviv that required my presence before the ""delayed"" flight's arrival, Aeroflot would not rebook my flight. I was lucky enough to have a travel agent for this trip, and they were able to demand that Aeroflot rebook my flight to another airline after a lot of frustration on their part, requiring me to rush to another airport after a whole night of no sleep. The entire experience was handled so poorly and unprofessionally from beginning to end that I will never fly with Aeroflot again.",New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow,0,0,aeroflot-russian-airlines,handled so poorly,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,75e0343e-cae4-415b-b022-412333fc1284

I would just like to say that the way this airline schedules this flight is a recipe for stress and disaster. A friend of mine flew the same route and had the same thing happen to her. She had given me a heads up that I would have to go from one end of the Moscow airport to the next end in order to attempt to make my flight. She also warned me that my luggage would probably not arrive. She knew this as she had taken the same route two weeks before I did. The flight from Madrid to Moscow flight 2501 arrives at 5:50 PM at terminal D. Then you have to get though security to get to terminal F in order to take flight 220 which leaves at 7:05 PM from gate 57 at terminal F, which is the second to the last gate. I literally ran from one terminal to the next and then asked the security attendant if she could take me to the front of the line in order to make my flight. If I had not ran and had not asked to be taken to the front of the line I would have missed my flight. Once I arrived in Guangzhou, I was told my luggage did not arrive and would be delivered the next day. So, why have a route so tight that will cause passenger's luggage to always arrive a day late? If the airline is going to keep this schedule, they need to at least warn passengers that their luggage will arrive late and warn them that if they want to make their connecting flight they need to RUN to make it on board.

,Air Arabia,Economy Class,Aug-19,30th August 2019,1,0,1,UnitedArabEmirates,1,no,"This was probably the worst experience I've had with an airline. In hindsight, I should have opted for a full service airline even at the premium cost. Our flight was on the 22nd of August, Sharjah to Kuala Lumpur. We paid for seats up-front (in row no. 4) hoping that we'd be able to travel with others who place a premium on their peace of mind and convenience. I could not have been more wrong about this. As soon as I sat in my seat, a raucous, rowdy group of customers walked in and sat right in front of us in Rows no. 2 and 3. At first, it just looked like a bunch of young people who were flying to KL for a good time and they'd settle in after a few hours of in-flight fun. Something told me that this trip was going to be problematic, but I just chalked that up to older me nerves. Drink service started. Our merry band selected a plane load of coffee and Red Bull for dinner to go with some sandwiches that AA provided. Being an overnight flight, once service was stopped, cabin crew switched off their lights. As they say, the party started after the lights went off. The group on the left put on their reading lamps which needless to say is quite jarring and did not aid in anyone falling asleep in a 2 m radius. The group on the right seemed sober and some of them curled up to sleep. The others were high on Coffee and Red Bull so they were fully charged up.  I went up to the cabin crew and requested them to ask this bunch to simmer down. It was about midnight UAE time and it is my belief that a paying customer is entitled to his sleep during the flight. To my surprise the cabin crew shrugged and said there was nothing they could do. Apparently, this was a group of 'bloggers' who were invited by Air Arabia to review the airline or its holiday package. The cabin crew supervisor went so far as to tell me to go complain if I wanted to and they couldn't care less. The shenanigans continued late into the night and at this time, my normally docile wife spoke up. We asked them respectfully to tone it down so that we could get some sleep before our onward flight to the next destination to which we got a casual dismissal and was yelled back at. Cabin crew came to calm down the situation, which was the best they could do. After this incident, their belligerence was unfettered for the reminder of the flight. The laughing and the talking were louder and unbelievably uncivilized.  In effect, I paid additional to be harassed by a bunch of low-life thugs aided and abetted by the service provider. We were rendered powerless by an apathetic cabin crew and an airline that frankly does not give two hoots about the rights of its paying passengers.

Unfortunately, our recent trip leaves us questioning whether or not we will ever risk using their services again. If you have or have traveled with someone with, a disability, you know how important it is that boarding the aircraft be done in an organized manner. Those that have issues (health, age, children, etc) need that little extra time before regular boarding commences. It's not meant to be a free-for-all. Well, not unless you board your Aeromexico (AM) flight out of the satellite Mexico City airport, NLU (Santa Lucia). NLU is a relatively brand new airport (opened March 2022) and it appears that the AM staff has yet to be trained on basic procedures. We had 2 bad experiences in NLU. The first was flying in on the way to Veracruz and the second was the return trip out. While the first flight was total chaos, we were fortunate enough that several of the gentlemen at the front of the line saw that my husband was an amputee, etc, and immediately waved us to the front. While this was disorganized, it wasn't the mess that the return flight out of NLU was. The second flight, NLU to Guadalajara was a nightmare. There was absolutely no control over the passengers. When it was time to board, there were no zones or even basic pre-boarding. AM had a group of 20-30 who appeared to be traveling together (not young, disabled, etc) who were let on first. We were about halfway in the line. There was no Premier boarding -- one of the benefits that AM promises its passengers who pay a bit more. Nope, it was a cluster eff free-for-all. Oh, silly my. I forgot to mention not only does my 76-year-old amputee husband need the special boarding, but WE WERE also PAYING PREMIER PRICES for the early boarding. We didn't get it. So, we finally get to our seats and watched as there was no control as the passengers boarded. Several economy passengers just casually jammed their stuff in the Premier overhead bins. Result? Hubby had problems with his carry-on (which had his meds) and which came off badly scuffed. Please understand, I realize that space is limited on flights, but if you pay for certain benefits, you should get those benefits. We did not. I wrote to complain and got the stand ""too bad, so sad"" letter in return. I had asked for compensation. Of course, that's not going to happen. No, I wasn't looking for a free flight or reimbursement of our tickets. As my girl Judge Judy says, ""we ate the steak.""

No one is responding my call. In no way is it possible to get decent help or assistance and figuring out if everything is still in the running is all up to you to follow up your booking.

I initially chose Air Caraïbes because the flight was ridiculously cheap, only €150 for a transatlantic flight! The airport and gate were typical for a mid-sized Caribbean airport - it had what I needed, but nothing more. When I first saw the plane, I realized how brand new it looked - it was an A350-1000. Getting on board, the modern feel of the cabin was obvious. I had a seat in the very back row, but still the seat was comfortable and it had above-average legroom. It came with your usual screen equipped with a good number of entertainment options. What really caught my eye with the screens, though, was the exterior cameras. I had a middle row, so it was amazing to still be able to watch the takeoff from a tailfin-mounted camera, and now I wish every plane had that! The food was excellent, there was only one option as far as I could tell but I did really enjoy the food, yet it was simple enough that most people would like at least some portion of it. Communicating with staff went fine with the basic amount of French I know as a Canadian, and anyone who complains about them not speaking English is obviously a little self-centred and doesn't realize that this is a local Caribbean airline serving only French locations, they shouldn't have to learn English to help out the 1 American traveller on a flight. Even with all of that, all of the gate announcements and in-flight announcements were also said in English, so I don't really get how this could be much of a problem. I will say that it was unfortunate that their main website had an English page but the booking screen was only in French, but again, I don't really hold it against them and got it booked with a little help from Google Translate. If you can't handle that, just book it from Expedia or something.

All this within 10 minutes or so.. I then received an e-mail confirming that the flight was booked and he was ready to fly. Great, no problem. In the meantime Alejandro got the notice that it was time to check in. When he attempted to check in on line he was unable to do so, and instead was notified that he had to see a gate agent. On Monday October 24, Alejandro got to the airport and went to the ticket counter where he was told that the ticket had not been paid, and he’d have to pay about $436.00 for a new ticket. Not having any other recourse, and needing to get home, he reluctantly paid the exhorbitant amount that Aeromexico required. The next day, he called Aeromexico and told then that the money had been originally paid for the ticket and that he wanted a refund of the more than $400.00 that he was forced into paying. Their response was to offer to refund the $169.04 that was the original cost of the ticket. Note that offering that, indicates that they know they were paid originally and they knew how much.

The flight SVO-PEK was 1 h late in PEK as well, and I was put in Beijing in a hotel for 24 h to wait for the next Air China flight. My visit to ULN was planned as 2 days long, so I requested an Aeroflot agent to send me back to AMS, as my trip had lost its purpose. The Aeroflot Agent in Beijing spoke very poor English, and he ignored my request without a reason provided, but recommended to call to Moscow during office hours in Moscow (it was 3 am in Moscow at the time of this conversation) and discuss this with people from central office. As long as it would be too late then, and because in my experience Aeroflot client support is useless and helpless, I went to the hotel (the hotel was very poor and in a very strange location, btw). Re. inflight experience. All the Aeroflot long haul cabins I was in (A330 for AMS-SVO and B777 for SVO-PEK) were tired, did not look very clean and chairs were not the best. In contrast, both B737 for ULN-SVO and A321 for SVO-AMS were brand new and clean. Meals were very decent on AMS-SVO-AMS, decent on ULN-SVO and very unimpressive on SVO-PEK, especially a weird plastic-packed cooky before the landing that was (I suspect) designed as a breakfast.

Many people say Aeroflot are a fraud and that it’s a bad airline but these people are totally wrong since they have changed totally from their past and now it probably is the world’s most underrated airline company. The crew was amazingly polite and kind but the one of the only issues was the cabin temperature was too hot on the way home (Tokyo-Moscow) but at least they listened and did what they could to make it better unlike many other companies who would have totally ignored it. The food wasn’t the best either especially when the plane originated from Moscow but from Japan it was way way better.

Moscow to Almaty on a new Boeing 767, with personal entertainment screens and mood lighting. Staff accommodating and professional. The meal was delicious with metal cutlery. Wine and beer were complimentary (no spirits on the menu, though), and extras were served with no frowns. IFE was one of the best I experienced, no lag whatsoever. One weird thing was that the screen by design could not be adjusted when the seat in front was reclined, so the viewing angles could be uncomfortable. We were given outstanding amenity kits with neck air pillow, slippers, pen, some hand cream, eye shades and ear plugs. Different coloured kits seemed to have slightly different content, so make sure to collect them all. The crew passed the cabin with drinks several times after the meal service. Seat comfort was okay, nothing outstanding. Almaty to Delhi was on an older A321, with no personal screens. The seats were very comfortable with great seat pitch and traditional ""thick"" profile of the seats. Cabin crew were lovely and the meal was even better. There were some amenity kits given as well, except a bit smaller ones (which makes sense on a 3 hour daytime flight). You could access their entertainment via your own device and onboard wi-fi for free with no issues, and the selection was impressive, but the lack of power ports meant you will run out of power quite soon. Delhi to Almaty was practically the same as the flight from Almaty to Delhi. For Almaty - Moscow I have made a bet to upgrade on their website (the lowest amount possible), and we were upgraded to business. The flight on a Boeing 767 was wonderful with lie-flat seats, lots of privacy and space, great IFE and pleasant cabin. The cabin crew were very accommodating, greeting us with champagne as a pre-departure drink, and the purser greeted us by name, making sure we had a fantastic flight. Meals were delicious, each course was brought separately. If I could think of any improvement in business class, it would be alcohol menu, because there were just one type of champagne, one type of white and red wine (plus lots of spirits and cocktails). I believe the wine card can and should be improved. Their Bloody Mary was perfect, by the way. Almaty airport is an absolute disaster - it's small, crowded, with nowhere to sit or relax, no decent cafes, everyone is shouting at everyone. Even in business class lounge there is nothing to eat or drink for free, which is just a disgrace. Our luggage made it, and the flights were on time, though.

Again, this wouldn't have been an issue under normal circumstances. I spoke to the baggage handler who told me to come talk to him prior to the next mornings flight, which was due to leave at 6am. I was forced to pay for a taxi which totalled 100 Euro each way (with promises of reimbursement) to the hotel which the company had placed passengers in only to stay there for 4 hours before having to leave again to catch the rescheduled flight. When I went to see the baggage handler I wasn't able to find anyone in the department. I went to the Air Berlin help desk and after explaining the situation to the woman at the desk she said there was nothing she could do. I asked if she was able to call the person who handled baggage as I needed to put my checked luggage on the new flight and she said she could but wasn't going to. When I asked again, saying ""Please, I need to catch my flight on time. I can't wait for someone to answer me knocking at the door, my flight leaves in less than an hour and I have to go through security"" She promptly said to me (in these exact words) ""Why don't you just do everyone a favour and go away."" I flew to my destination sans baggage and deeply offended. Being under 19 years old at the time and a solo flyer I am to this day outraged by the lack of sympathy and understanding of the customer support team. I had to wait 4 whole weeks for my luggage to arrive at my final destination. The airline owes me over 500 Euros in reimbursement, which it has managed to avoid paying due to their own fiscal troubles.

I have travelled approximately 75-100 legs on this airline for business and have purchased several tickets to and from Moscow for both myself and my fiance. You’d think this sort of ‘loyalty’ (is it really loyalty when you consider the lack of available options?) would earn me a little more respect than what I received today, but judging from my experience with the gate agents contracted by the airline at various airports, all I seem to get is ignorance and hostility. Customer service is arguably not very highly esteemed in Central Asia in my experience so I’m long past expecting “service with a smile.” I was caught unawares today by a excess baggage fee when flying out of Dushabe. Apparently Air Astana has recently started offering bare bones fares whose limitations are in no way reflected in the pricing. These fares offer a downright insulting 1 kg baggage limit (10kg for Nomad Club Silver members) when the standard tickets allow for 20kg (30kg) respectively. I unknowingly booked this fare through a third-party website where there was no indication that this wasn’t a standard fare ticket. As I said, the ticket price wasn’t particularly cheap. I expect this sort of thing from FlyDubai or Wizz Air but from a national flagship airline? Seriously? Of course what incentive do you have to treat repeat customers well when you practically have a government-backed monopoly? And about the Nomad Club, it’s quite possibly the stingiest airline rewards program there is.

With all flights on the route being served by Aeroflot. I had only 75 minutes to change in Sheremetyevo. Why do you let the booking systems to sell the tickets with such a small time to connect. It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it. So if you travel via Moscow's Sheremetyevo you have to have at least two hours for the transfer. I arrived in Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo airport with the next Aeroflot's flight, but my luggage didn't, it arrived two flight later almost at midnight. The ground service of Pulkovo airport offered me to wait for my luggage two and a half hours. They offered me to fill in some papers and lied that if I will put 24 hours contact permission, it will simply mean, that they will have a right to send me sms 24/7, in fact, I later figured out that it meant that they can deliver my luggage 24/7. The next day I call to Pulkovo luggage service to ask about my luggage delivery, and they inform me that I will only get it from 20:00 to 8:00, at night.

A little annoying, but fine. However, the trip home was absolutely wretched lol and I cannot emphasize this enough. To start, when we arrived to check in (2 hours before boarding) there was already an announcement stating the flight was delayed by 1 hr. Once boarded we sat for an additional HOUR on the tarmac, causing us to miss our connecting flight home (amazingly the only flight of theirs that left only 15 minutes late). They re-routed us to Seattle, which meant an addition 2.5 hour layover before boarding the connecting flight. There was no offer of food or beverages even though we were missing our in-flight meal service. Once we boarded the connecting flight we AGAIN sat for 1 hour and 45 minutes in the tarmac. No offer of snacks or food. Mind you we are about 4 hours past when we should of had out meal service so we were starving.

Firstly, the flight from Colombo to Sharjah was delayed for about 4 hours which led in missing the connecting flight to Bahrain. Any normal airline would at least provide passenger with correct information. At Sharjah airport (which is another part of terrible story), none of the staff had clear information. The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by ""Help Desk"". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight ""any when!!"". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm. I was told that no need to get new boarding pass you will fly on the same boarding pass. At around 5pm, after sitting on chairs at Sharjah airport in miserable and uncomfortable environment, I was given another news. That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just ""wait and we will call you"" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding. This clearly shows the mentality of the airlines where they have made their money and let the poor people be as stand by.

We were not allowed to leave the plane for couple of hours until they released us to the transit lounge which was holding the passengers of another 7 planes.

We had a change in our plans and I had to change my ticket to an evening flight. This particular fare allows changes for the same day with no fee and seats were available on the new flight so I logged into my reservation and changed the flight successfully.  I then tried to reserve a window seat on the new flight but noticed that only middle seats were available for free. This seemed strange since the flight was not sold out and ComfortFlex tickets allow free seating in the entire aircraft except for the exit row seats, where a charge applies. I then noticed that the only window or aisle seats available on my new flight were those at the exit row and those would involve an extra 9 Euro charge. As I'm about to proceed with the payment of this 9 Euro charge, my boyfriend informs me he will be joining me on the same flight. We book a new ticket for him and when we reach the seat map on his reservation, we can see plenty window and aisle seats available for free. We decide to call the Aegean call center to inquire why our reservations show different seats maps even though we've both purchased ComfortFlex tickets and we're traveling on the same flight. Their response was that it must be a systemic error and if we wanted, we could wait until going to the airport and request a window or an aisle seat there. If anyone of you has ever called Aegean for similar matters, you'll know that 9 out of 10 times, it's always the ""system"". It's evident that they're manipulating the availability of their seat maps to force you to pay extra fees even when you've purchased their highest economy class fare.  We paid the 9 Euro fee this time but from our main choice, they will become our last choice until they get their act together. And of course it came as no surprise to read so many other reviews here from other passengers complaining about similar situations.

However, on Monday they notified us that the flight has been changed from 21.03 to 23.03 due to ""Spring flight schedule corrections"", thus completely eliminating any chance of using these Holidays for a trip. These types of corrections are definitely planned way in advance and should have been addressed BEFORE offering promotions on the dates.

Refunds that took 18 months and countless calls and e-mails to process (for flights that Aegean Airlines canceled).

Although I had checked-in online I had to join a mixed queue combining several destinations with this airline. There was one rather rude female employee who bizarrely pushed and I do mean push 6 passengers behind a yellow line. She said that the queue started behind the yellow line the people she pushed included two very frail elderly gentlemen. There was no apology from the staff member and she then allowed a group of teenagers to queue jump! I approached the foreign staff member who did not even have the manners to answer me and she then walked off. Several bag drop machines did not work and so I assisted several elderly people including an non-English speaking couple to use the machines. This was not good enough to state the obvious. I shall add that boarding was not well managed with certain passengers allowed to carry far too much luggage onto the flight. The aircraft was modern with inflight entertainment but the seats were thin and uncomfortable. There was a delay taking off and very poor communication from the crew on a very full flight. Once the flight arrived in Dublin there was no gate available for over 30 minutes the captain did not communicate this well and several Americans were worried about not making their flight on time. Disembarkation was like a rugby scrum. The luggage took a rather long time to come through in Dublin and there was little help at hand for passengers and only a few machines on which to log a complaint! This was a shambles and a poor quality experience for a rather expensive short flight. What a poor impression this creates of this Airline and indeed of Dublin.

On our flight from Chicago to Mexico City our bags were forcibly checked for being the “last to check in” even though we checked in via their app at 6am Thursday for a 12:30am Friday flight and then checked in again upon arrival at the airport at 7pm. This was the first flight to be delayed, the staff at the gate and flight attendants were beyond rude and unhelpful, and the plane ride itself was horrendous. Our flight home from Cancun to Mexico City was delayed for over an hour and we were not informed of this delay until we were supposed to be boarding, we still do not know why the plane was delayed. We had a connecting flight to make in Mexico City which we made them aware of and they promised 3 times that we would make it, Mexico City would hold the plane for us. We were told we would touch down in Mexico City at 6pm, instead we touched down at 6.37. Our connecting flight left at 6.50. We ran across the airport only to miss our connecting flight and play the game of how are we getting home. It was a struggle to find anyone in the airport in uniform who spoke enough English to understand us. Person after person just told us, we don’t speak English, sorry we can’t help you. We finally get someone to help us book a new flight that was 15 hours later. Aeromexico gave us vouchers for a hotel, transportation, and some food. Very generous, thank you. We get to the hotel they put us in to find out the hotel was booked up completely and we were going to have to wait 30 minutes to then be shuttled another 20 to a new hotel. By this time it was 12.30 in the morning and we had to be up again at 5 just to head back for our new flight. It was such a frustrating travel day. Our new flight starts boarding on time at 9am, we are so excited to be leaving and leaving on time until we sit on the plane fully boarded for 40 minutes before we even take off. Again, the flight was delayed. Out of 4 flights in total that we took on this one trip, 3 flights were delayed for at least 40 minutes. I do not recommend flying with Aeromexico and I especially do not recommend flying with them when you have a connecting flight. Your odds of making it are slim.

Inability to arrive/depart on time, lack of accountability, Lying to customers and blaming air traffic control for company delays to avoid issuing hotel vouchers, cabin crew who disappear during the flights. I arrived 2 hours ahead of departure time and checked in with no problem. I was told that flight was on time and boarding would start 320PM for a 4:10 PM departure. The plane arrived at 3:40 in Merida. Shortly after they announced that, the flight would be delayed until 5pm due to air traffic control delays. A big lie of course. Around 430PM the gate paged me and told me that I should not get on the plane because most likely my connecting flight would depart before we arrived. The gate agent manager said tough luck and refused my accommodation request. I opted to board and take my chances.  When we arrived my flight was still on the ground. But the pilot parked 3 feet short of the spot he needed to be and a tow truck took 15 minutes to move the plane another 3 feet. First class disembarked using the staircase, but then the staircase broke and another 15 minutes were required to get another staircase. Pilots did not inform the passengers about the bad parking job nor the staircase. My name was removed from the passenger manifest to Miami without even informing me or asking consent. The new flight was the next day. With me off the passenger manifest, my original flight to Miami could take off without me. After I made a huge scene in the middle of the hundreds of people waiting at the Mexico city counter, I was awarded a hotel room and 4 hours of sleep.

It was the worst airline experience I have had in about 20 years of frequent flying. Here are some key reasons: Customer Service is non-existent. No one ever answers their phone number and their online service always returns an error message. I tried for two weeks both online and on telephone with one simple request, to upgrade my seat on my return flight (in other words, pay them more money!). One night, with Expedia on the line with me, we waited on hold for 95 minutes and I finally fell asleep at 1am. Also, with one exception on return flight, every single Air Berlin person I dealt with was not only extremely poor at customer service, but even rude. One flight attendant was just mean to the person in front of me who asked if they could give them their trash. Another flight attendant was rude when I asked a simple question at the counter. Another in baggage claim area in Berlin was rude. Their seats in economy are smaller than any other airline seat I have experienced. I had an eight hour flight with the seat back in front of me literally 10 inches from my face. I am 5 feet 5 inches and my knees hit the seat in front of me the whole time. Be aware they will charge you $60-100 extra just to pick a seat - any seat, including economy - in advance of your flight. The WIFI does not work. I paid for WiFi going over and back and was never able to get on it. The flight attendants were no help whatsoever and were again rude when I inquired The worst part was that I experienced two delayed flights - one from Berlin to Salzburg and one from Berlin to Chicago. Both were handled terribly. When I arrived late in Chicago to make my connection to MSP, I literally ran to the gate and got there in time to get on the flight, but Air Berlin without my consent or knowledge had changed my flight to a flight 4 hours later instead and American Airlines would not let me get on my original flight. When I called Air Berlin to complain about this while sitting in ORD for 4 hours, I again waited on hold for 2 hours and finally decided they did not deserve any more of my time or effort in giving them feedback.

I find its hard to say I will never fly this airline again as: 1) I have to be flexible with the availability and 2) it would probably delete all options as there will most likely be unfortunate circumstances one time or another. Air Berlin is in a league of its own. The flights are usually delayed out of Budapest and not that its great, but its doable. But what I don't get is the incredible lack of communication. No one informs the 20 some passengers that the connecting flight will be there waiting. They don't at all care about the stress the passengers are in. Side note: If you are unlucky to be parked in another terminal (20 minutes left to your departure), they will not take any effort whatsoever in informing you where to go or even update the screens signalling delays. Then you're hit with a one lane open security control, again they don't care if the flight you're about to take is leaving in 5 minutes its slow. Yesterdays flight, once we got in the bus, the driver hacked this thing causing most of us to almost fall over and then once out of the bus, they refused to open the doors cause there was another group let in from another plane in the connecting terminal. Now we were running extremely late and running to the gate. All gates had the destinations show on the screen as is usually the case, except for the one going to Stockholm, so we ran up and asked and were brushed off. They tell us to go outside and what do we find? A bus parked right by the gate a plane right in front of us and one far to the right and again, nothing is marked. I mean, when you fly Ryanair or Wizz Air or any of these cheepy ones, its all marked. Why is this so difficult to figure out? Well obviously it is not, it is due to the lack of care. They think their passengers are a painful must. No communication whatsoever. All this anxiety and stress for the passengers, especially when you're taking the last flight out is unnecessary. Last time I flew them, my luggage got stuck in Berlin for 4 days. I have one more ticket in my pre-purchased pile and then that's it. Never again.

,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,Dec-18,19th December 2018,5,4,5,Malaysia,10,yes,"Prague to Ho Chi Minh via Moscow. Having seen negative reviews, we (two adults, three kids 3-10 yo) decided to leave a review here too because we found the airline was excellent in many aspects. Check-in: no hick-up. It was opened two hours before flight, maybe due to Prague's policy, not airline. We wish the airport/airlines may consider this as we found the immigration at Prague was excruciatingly slow, almost deliberately by the staff who manned the counter. We were asked numerous questions and he perused through each passport very slowly without apparent reason. We made it to the flight a few minutes after boarding time had closed despite being number four to check-in. A few travellers were also late behind us.Thankfully Aeroflot waited for us! Our baggage were checked in all the way to Ho Chi Minh where we collected each of them safely. Food: We requested Muslim food. As the PRG-MOW was below 3 hours, special meal request could not be entertained (Aeroflot's policy). This is an aspect which the airline could improve. We came well-prepared with outside food and were not told off by the steward/ess. Orange juice was particularly nice. From MOW to SGN, we were provided with Muslim meal in a very well-presented boxes. It came with halal certification information booklet by a Russian halal authorisation agency. This is much better than the handwritten or sticker of MOML as in other airlines. Aeroflot scores highly from us for ensuring total confidence over the food that they serve. In flight magazine: They certainly have listened to complaints and we are happy to report that they have an in-flight magazine in English, in addition to the thick Russian one. Good job Aeroflot! We now have Nov and Dec 2018 issues as part of our collection! In flight entertainment: Aeroflot may have the largest selection of movies to watch in addition to excellent games for kids. They also have good selection of local (Soviet and Russian) hits. Every passenger was supplied with earphones. The quality of the screen and audio was excellent. 5. For kids, they received two different sets of bag/toy/stationeries/games for the two legs of travel. Very nice bag that my youngest keeps wearing everyday even after a week off the plane! Very nice touch from the Aeroflot! 6. Cabin crew were polite and gentle enough throughout the flight, at check in counter and when speaking with the kids. Amenities on board were also good including blanket, socks, soft slippers and eyemask on the MOW-SGN. Overall cabin experience was great. The flight was warm, clean and spacious enough with reclining seats, and lift-able armrest, allowing my kids to sleep on my laps. Overall Moscow Sheremetyevo experience was excellent. Immigration was polite and quick. Airport facilities were great. There is even a family room at Terminal D which could be booked for free to up to 24hrs by a family that has at least one <7 yo. It has beds for small kids and sofas for older ones, a playing room, nappy changing room, basic kitchen (for warming baby foods and hot water) and private toilet. It is manned by a personnel who just need to be shown the passports and boarding passes. We used 12 flights for this particular trip, and Aeroflot scored highest. It was a positive experience for all of us. We were not expecting this as the price was unbelievably low for PRG-SGN (below MYR1000 per person). We have no hesitant to use and to recommend Aeroflot in the future.

Boarding took quite a while, but once we got underway the flight was enjoyable. The crew were pleasant and spoke basic English. The 2 meal services were efficient and the food wasn't bad at all. Only negative is that alcoholic drinks aren't served on domestic flights (even though it was 8.5hrs long). The IFE had a decent selection of Western films in English and the sound quality was very good, particularly compared to that on some of Aeroflot's other aircraft.

Interesting boarding and seating announcements were started while passengers were boarding rather than after the doors had closed. I thought this was a good use of crew time.

When we arrived in Moscow it was a huge mess. We had to wait for five hours before they let us go to the hotel. Some passengers got food vouchers, some didn't.

Staff attitude extremely bad and arrogant. It's already awful enough if you involuntarily have to spend a night extra because your flight is delayed. As for the hotel accommodation. It started with the check-in where  tired passengers had to wait in the bus, while tiny batches of people were allowed to check in. Once we got off the bus we had, additionally to our already four hour wait at the airport, wait again for half an hour to get our room cards. Three hours before check-in I already knew that I'd be staying in Novotel, how come they were not prepared and just handed over the keys. What terrible logistics!! In the morning after shower I found there was no body lotion and toothbrush. In the bathroom it said: if you need anything just call 75. Which I did, only to receive a rude reminder that I'm not a 'real' guest and should get the items at the reception myself. Once I went to this reception, the chap didn't even understand what I wanted. So together we called 75 and now they delivered.

I had to wait five minutes before someone could print me out a new boarding pass and eventually I got an aisle seat. I went to clear immigration and was told once i had had my passport stamped that I needed to pay 200Syrian pounds airport tax (mentioned nowhere even at check-in). I had to go back through security to buy the tax then go back airside and push my way through to the front of the immigration queue (I had been queuing at check- in so long the flight was boarding). Once on the plane it appeared that the flight was only half full and I had the entire row to myself so why they could initially only give me a middle seat I don't know.

,Air Berlin,Business Class,Apr-17,10th April 2017,1,1,1,DominicanRepublic,1,no,"New York JFK to Duesseldorf. The worst service in a business class cabin I've received. There was nothing that I could say positive about this flight 7481 of Air Berlin departing April 8 from JFK to Dusseldorf. Arrived at JFK with more than 3 hours in advance. There were people in the priority /business line waiting because the two staff that attended the site, were gone for a break , and no other attendance paid attention to us. Suddenly another travelers that arrived after us were allowed to go through, and when I complained, a very young man responded that they were attending first the Berlin passengers (was no way this gentleman could know, without asking, whether I was going also to Berlin?) When we arrived at the time of boarding (we were told at the counter that there was going to be a 25 minutes delay), we had to wait for an hour without anybody explaining what was going on. We later found out that they had to switch the aircraft, and make the catering. When we finally boarded, never were we were approached by our names, I had to wear my jacket, since nobody came to ask for it. Food (bad catering), but that was not all. My dinner selection was Rissotto with a pinot grigio the staff brought me the rissotto  with a red wine when I told her that that was not my wine, and that I order the grigio, I think I spoke in esperanto, since she had no idea what I was talking about: I said white wine, and she said ok, and she never came back with the wine. Tire of waiting, I sipped a horrible red wine, and my wife took it and changed it for a chardonnay she was having. Dessert with the whole tray occupied with the other plates. The cabin was a mess, the flight staff spent the flight running, coming and going, and that is the reason why I did not have the chance to request for some better treatment. My only comfort was that this was a 6 hours flight. At the end, when we were to land the flight attendant asked me to put my jacket back since I couldn't have it in my hands.

Boeing 737-800,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,Economy Class,Aug-18,8th August 2018,2,3,3,RussianFederation,4,no,"Moscow to Istanbul. Aeroflot is definitely not a premium airline it thinks it is, because their economy experience is simply embarrassing. Moscow - Istanbul was on a 5-year old Boeing 737-800, but the cabin looked like it was 15 years old with no maintenance. Everything was scuffed, slightly teared, shaky etc. The seats were unbelievably, and I mean it, unbelievably tight. It was seriously painful to sit upright in the seat, because if you are of average height, your knees will be firmly pressed into the hard and rough metal bar, which is conveniently located right where your knees are supposed to be. The fact that the armrests were quite wide made the seat even less spacious. I lucked out in not having a neighbour in the next seat, but I seriously doubt it I would have handled the flight if it was 100% full. The cabin crew were grumpy and sloppy (with one exception), and their attitude regarding safety was unbelievable - they just didn't care. They never properly checked the cabin before take off and failed to enforce the safety rules (since they cared so little), so the plane took off with open tray tables, closed windows, passengers laying across the seats with no seatbelts, passengers streaming something from their devices with no headphones. I have never experienced anything like this, I felt like this was a bad dream or a good comedy, but it was neither. The meal service was alright. I ordered a kosher meal, which is always a fine choice on Aeroflot, and it was much bigger than the regular meals. Nothing extraordinary, plastic cutlery, no menus, but it was fine. There was no wine, beer or any other alcohol onboard, not even for purchase, which is just so embarrassing for the ""best airline of Eastern Europe"". I must also note that their main full-service competitors on this route - Turkish Airlines and Atlasglobal - both serve beer and wine, and their meals are much tastier. There was no entertainment onboard. You could apparently stream entertainment via their wi-fi network, but it kept failing. The landing in Istanbul was really rough, and then the plane spent 20 minutes slowly driving through the airport. The passengers thought it was a great time to stand up, open the overhead bins, start packing while the plane was in motion and something could easily fall down on someone's head, and the crew did nothing to stop it. So, once again, major safety hazard. Istanbul-Moscow was another story. It was Boeing 737-800 with the same seating chart, but the plane was newer, and the seats were better. Their design allowed for more legroom, and while it still wasn't spacious, it was tolerable. I still don't get why they decided to have a magazine pocket at the top of the seat (which is a great idea for maximising legroom) and at the knee level as well, because that doesn't make any sense from any perspective and shows poor management, but at least there were no metal bars this time. The seats felt super flimsy and cheap, though, with the whole row shaking and creaking whenever someone moved. I wonder if this plane will age well, because it seems like it will not. Cabin crew were much more pleasant this time around, and they actually made sure the people were seated with their seatbelts on. No wine or beer once again. The kosher meal was exactly the same, which was fine. The flight was delayed for 30 minutes with no explanation or apology.

My assigned seat in Row 1 had been shifted to Row 4 (last row of business class which I always try very hard to avoid) -- and when I discovered it -- I found that it was impossible to change because the other seats were already allocated. The transfer desk at Seoul said that there was a system glitch preventing them from entering my Lufthansa Miles & More Number into the system -- meaning that I would have to save my boarding pass and mail it in after I returned. I resent the imposition on my time. The seats were slanted and I slid off the seat while trying to sleep on it. I may have gotten two hours of sleep on a seven hour flight.

There were delays (30-60min.) and the cabin crew was rude and unaccommodating. We don't speak Spanish and it was obvious that they had a problem with that. Especially one lady who was really nice to all Spanish speaking passengers but when I asked her something I got just one word answer in a really impolite way. Another flight with Aeromexico was supposed to be from Puerto Vallarta to Mexico City and from there to Vancouver on 25/Aug. As the first flight got delay almost 3 hours we weren't able to catch our second flight. Lady at the PV airport was unhelpful, and after we approached her, she told us that we had just 2 options. Stay one more night and take the same route next day, or take the first flight to Mexico city and wait there for the second flight to Vancouver till next day. We've been told that it wasn't Aeromexico's fault therefore they won't provide us hotel or meals. After we got out, to our surprise our original flight to Vancouver just began boarding right at the next gate. We happily get there to realize that we can not get in. Why? Nobody knows again. At first they told us because of ""weight and balance"" after that because they didn't have available seats and so on. It was two of us and another 15-20 people including families with small children who weren't able to get in. We were trying to understand this situation but after 30 minutes no reasonable explanation came. We accepted vouchers for hotel and meals as at the airport in Mexico city miraculously could provide them. Next day after we got back to the airport we were trying to get confirmation about the flight delay as we supposed to be already in the work in that time but we were stuck in Mexico. Of course customer service at the airport was as bad as the lady at our first flight so we got nothing. Finally 50 minutes after our flight was scheduled we were finally boarding, still not sure if we can get in this time. We got in and after almost an hour we started rolling and captain is speaking to us. Unfortunately we had to have a stop in Tijuana to get fuel. In the end this flight had 3 hours delay (+24 hours). I never heard sorry or any kind of apology till this moment. One more thing, after we got vouchers for meals and hotel we've been told that we can catch Aeromexico shuttle in front of the T2 gate which take us to the hotel. We've been there for almost 30 min. and what we've seen was just shuttle for crew. At the hotel we've learned that we should have vouchers for taxi too but we didn't have them so we paid 2 fairs with taxi by ourselves.

,Aeromexico,Economy Class,Sep-21,8th September 2021,1,1,1,Canada,1,no,"I have flown on many airlines and have had few problems. I consider myself pretty easy going but Aeromexico really put my nerves to the test. I will just make a list: -My luggage was broken into and my jewellery stolen during my 5 hour layover in Mexico City on my way to Los Cabos. I reached out to the complaints department but not surprisingly no one has responded (weeks later). Upon my return to Toronto, I once again had a short layover for 2 hours in Mexico City. While lining up at the gate to get on the aircraft, the staff closed the door while 15 passengers remained behind standing, me and my family included. it was stressful, messy and confusing and the staff said nothing to us about what was happening, they just pointed a finger for us to go to customer service. That's when we discovered we had been bumped off our flight for the next 24 hours and they couldn't even guarantee us that we wouldn't be bumped again the next day. The customer service rep. explained that we couldn't go on the flight because of weight/balance issues, and that's when my husband and I came to the conclusion that passengers are being kicked off the flight in order to make room for more lucrative cargo. We collected our luggage for the 24 hour delay because after my initial experience, we did not trust our luggage sitting in the Airport with out them being rummaged through and items stolen. When we received our luggage, my bag was heavily damaged and a wheel completed ripped off so I could barely manage rolling it around the airport and to our hotel. The next day we checked in 3 hours before our flight because we wanted to avoid any issues. The line up at the gate was a crowded mess, it felt like I was going to get trampled on. Once seated and on the plane the crew made an announcement that a few passengers would not be coming on the plane again and that their luggage needed to be removed from the plane. So the airline was again doing to others what we experienced the day before. At that point, the passenger sitting behind me told the flight attendant that she just saw the ground crew taking her bag off the plane even though she was still on it, at which point the flight attendant left for a couple minutes and when he came back the plane just started to pull out and he said there was nothing he could do about it at this point. Once we arrived in Toronto Pearson Airport, and made it through customs, my husband and I discovered that our luggage was also taken off the plane in Mexico City. After filling out the necessary paperwork, the Aeromexico luggage attendant informed us that we should have our luggage delivered to us no later than Tuesday September 7th. It has been 4 days now since we landed, with multiple phone calls and emails made on my part, no one from Aeromexico has contacted us about its whereabouts. And after having my personal items stolen out of my luggage on my 5 hour layover in Mexico City, I can only imagine what I will or will not have left in my luggage if Aeromexico ever returns our luggage to us. However, my daughters luggage WAS on the plane, and upon returning home she discovered she still had all her items in her bag but she also had extra items. Shirts and skirts that did not belong to her, which means the baggage staff at Aeromexico is opening peoples luggage to look for valuables and is just stuffing personal items back haphazardly in random suitcases.

A330,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,May-22,5th June 2022,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"I am a mother traveling alone with my infant son, and Aer Lingus has made our experience an absolute nightmare. I called to request a bassinet seat for my baby to be able to sleep on the 7 hour flight from Chicago to Dublin (8 hours on the way back), and I was told to contact Special Assistance through their website, which I did. I was then told via email that I was assigned row 30 on flight EI122, and was told this was a bassinet row. When I boarded the plane (which was two hours delayed), I arrived at my seat, baby in my arms, to discover that row 30 is a bulkhead row but nota bassinet row. The only bassinet row on the aircraft I was on is row 9. The flight attendants told me not much could be done, but finally we begged to switch with someone in row 9 and someone was kind enough to do it. However, I had to move back before landing so that the original passenger in row 9 could alight the plane first, so had to lug myself, my infant son, and all our stuff back and forth three separate times.  While onboard my flight to Chicago, I discovered eventually that my seat's media system was broken, the remote for it did not work, so that even though the screen seemed to be fine, I could not control anything/make anything play on it. This meant I could not watch anything, could not listen to anything, could not even call the flight attendant, turn on my own light. When I was finally able to alert a flight attendant and let them know, they brushed me off and said they would make a note of it, offering nothing else to help or compensate. I had no media available to me after I was able to get my baby to sleep in the bassinet they provided, which, by the way, is a beat up cardboard box lined with airline pillows, and airline blanket, and strapped in with straps that go above the baby's feet and right above the baby's head. Far from a nice set up. On the day before my original flight back from Dublin to Chicago, I tested positive for Covid 19. While I've been asymptomatic, I understand that the US requires negative tests to re-enter the country, and while it was an unfortunate situation, I anticipated being able to handle it. I did not  anticipate that Aer Lingus would have no policy for dealing with this kind of a situation. I once again waited on hold with them for over an hour to be told that in a situation like this, all they can offer is for you to change your flight for a large sum of money (over 450 euro in my case). They offer no flexibility which is impossible for a situation like this one. I can't imagine I am the only one (I'm probably one of hundreds if not thousands) who is having to reschedule their flight because they will not be let into the country due to unexpected test results. But Aer Lingus offer no sort of flight credit or flexibility, even though I have no way of knowing when I will test negative and be let back into the US. It could be in two days time, it could be in twenty days time, and Aer Lingus only seeks to make you change your flight over and over again, charging you more and more money each time, even though this is something completely out of the passenger's control. I finally booked a flight seven days away, and just hoped and prayed I would be negative by then, also knowing I would miss a good amount of work and income by being out of the country",Chicago to Dublin,1,1,aer-lingus,made our experience an absolute nightmare,Family Leisure,Trip Verified,1,1,4ec773de-fc3f-4292-906f-a7b0cd5673a6

A320,Air Berlin,Economy Class,Feb-17,23rd February 2017,2,1,4,Germany,8,yes,"Berlin Tegel to Bucharest. I would start my review with the regret that Air Berlin has stopped flying to Bucharest and those were one of the last flights operated by them. I know it is tough to keep pace with Ryanair but since Air Berlin has moved towards a quality service experience for its customers, maybe it would have been nice to get this experience on this route too. I must say that since I fly Air Berlin (and that is a lot of time) I only had once or twice that my flight was delayed. And those flights to/from Bucharest were both ahead of schedule. I have read it is not always the case but from my experience and point of view, I was really impressed to see so many flights on time. The aircrafts they are flying are new (I suppose the kept only the new ones in their fleet after the restructuring last year) and as a topbonus platinum I always get a seat with extra leg-room which makes flying with them a joyful experience. There are some things that are disturbing: the inflight entertainment system only shows ads of Air Berlin and their partners together with their destinations, over and over again. This becomes too much after some time and they never change. They have an App which you can use on your own device for WiFi and entertainment, but for my surprise you had to pay for watching TV-Series as well, not only for using the WiFi. They are many airlines which offer this service for free. Another thing that I find not right are the prices for the in-flight snacks and drinks. I understand that this is a new market strategy (is it really part of that high quality experience they are talking about?) but there are operators offering decent prices, not 3,5€ for a mineral water. And the coffee was really bad: a bag exactly like tea infused in hot water. I would expect more quality from their famous ""signature"" coffee. I think things are changing and the airline looks better like it used to be some years ago. The cabin crew members are more friendly but there is still much to do. Many people say it has the corporation mentality and they attention for client is low and that is partially true. I think being closer to the client in any way will make this airline better.",Berlin to Bucharest,5,4,air-berlin,the airline looks better,Solo Leisure,,3,1,050c3fc8-215e-408e-b32d-38ad4c993879

I did a few flights with them with a few minor problems (delayed flights, delayed luggage) I kept using them as I had already a bunch of miles and a gold status, but the last one was very bad and is the last drop. Connecting in Berlin will require you to change terminals by walking outside and going over security again. Their lounges are so bad that are almost always worse than the comparable regular waiting areas from better airlines. A lot of their web site is not working, specially if you are accesing it from outside of Germany. Their phone app is buggy and of very limited functionality. It is very hard to get hold of them on the phone, you have to navigate a maze of menus to get there and then wait for long periods of time. Their phone service is very fragmented, once I get to talk with someone it often happens that he or she can not do what I need and I need to call again. My average has been four calls to get anything done this is in total with waiting and menu navigation about 45 minutes. Their phone service is not 24 hours, if you are in a different time zone than Germany you may have to actually wake up in the middle of the night to call. It is practically impossible to make use of miles for flight upgrades in their own flights. It is effectively impossible to use their miles to upgrade or buy any service from other airlines on the network. Booking an award fligh on their own flights requires you to call them, again, this is difficult you cannot do it online. My last return flight was cancelled and I arrived with a 12 hour delay back home, losing a whole work day they didn't offer lounge access during my 12 hour wait at the San Francisco airport.

Okay for day flight in the seating position. Obviously those seats are not keeping Air Berlin's attractive promises (see their website). They should be changed. These seats are light years away from Qatar Airways Boeing 773-ER's and 772-LR's heavenly comfort). I did not use the IFE unless to track the route. So no idea of IFE's value but it offers a wonderful large screen and terrific high definition for the route tracker. I did not use the connectivity either, unless to charge my tablet battery but there are various sockets available (including USB). Drinks generally OK, real Champagne being an asset. Lunch food was nothing fancy but generally okay, snacks not so okay. Excellent service by highly motivated and attentive flight attendants as well as remarkably professional and kind check-in agent. Amenity kit included slippers, a definite asset as far as hygiene is concerned. Cabin was clean. No separate business class counter during ""night before check-in"" service!

Aeroflot apparently introduced a new dedicated counter for Business Class. So now they process separately Business class, Sky Priority and Economy passengers at the check in. Which might be a good idea at the main Aeroflot airports. However, in Prague it creates a lot of problems, confusions and discomfort. In the past, there was just common Business Class/Sky Priority counter and two for Economy. In this particular case, they checked in all 4 Business class passengers at one counter, 10 SkyPriority passengers at the other counter and all the remaining approx. 150 people at the single, remaining counter. In the past, they had two counters for economy, serving on average. 75 people each. Consequently, the new regime effectively doubled queues (and check in time) for economy passengers, but offered only a very little or no extra comfort for business passengers. Moreover, it disturbed the whole process, because people waiting in a very long queue were continuously trying to sneak in into SkyPriority.

Being my airline, as their Platinum member I must say that we do have a really complicated relationship. I fly them a lot inside Europe and the service is really depending on who is in the crew. It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it.

This was the first time that we had flown Air Astana and we were generally pretty impressed. Not quite up to the standard of the top Airlines but worth their 4 star Skytrax status. Outbound the meal was one of the best I've experienced in the air; with multiple courses presented separately and the food options varied and delicious. Inbound was another matter however with tasteless cold fish chicken that was a bit dry and less attractive options. Maybe the Caterer in Astana isn't as good as in London. Service both ways however was excellent with pre take-off drinks offered boiled sweets hot face towels drinks and nuts or canapés and very attentive staff. The seats were pretty comfy and whilst not fully flat (hopefully their Dreamliners on order will have fully flat seats in Business) they still had very decent recline and allowed for some sleep. (we were on a 757 for all sectors so if you get this aircraft type or a 767 on Domestic sectors then you're doing pretty well in Business Class for such a short flight - nothing like the terrible Business Class European Airlines offer on short haul flights). The Etihad Lounge at Heathrow was excellent; and it's very quiet at the time that Air Astana fly as there are no Etihad flights at this time however the Lounge in the Domestic Terminal at Almaty is really an embarrassment (small pokey room no natural light small snack counter charging for everything right down to a cup of tea!). Air Astana hand out tablets in Business Class as there are no seat back TV's. We found that we could hardly hear through the headphones on the way out but this was much better on the way back. The Moving Map however wasn't working on the way back and since the tablets aren't connected to the flight systems at all we had no idea where we were or how long until arrival for the whole flight. (even Economy Class presumably can access this info). Other minor irritations were the same 2 songs played continuously on loop when the aircraft is on the ground and the lovely new anti jet lag ceiling lighting system being inexplicably put through it's paces for the first few hours of the flight jumping between colours every few seconds. Terminal 4 at Heathrow was relatively quiet at the times Air Astana flew which made for a pleasant experience; and I can recommend Terminal 4 Long Stay Parking which is actually just across the main road from the Terminal - no more than 5 minutes in the shuttle bus!

According to them, I could have one change without penalty with no extra charge due to Covid-19. However, because I needed to change airports, I had to pay the penalty. Whilst on my first call, the girl I talked to told me that I needed to pay 100euros for the change whereas the next day I was told to pay 140euros for the same change (Note: The flight rate didn't change at all). Despite the difference, I changed my flight ticket asking for a baggage too. They booked my ticket without adding a baggage! I called yesterday to ask what happened and they were telling me that there was no charge for the baggage. Then, they told me they would listen to my recording and call me back. They called me two hours later the phone was ringing for 5 secs and I did not manage to pick it up. I called back and I was told that the girl who was assisting me finished her work for the day. The next person told me that would look into it but instead of putting me on hold, they hung up on me and never called back! I called again today, the assistant could not find the notes of the first person who listened to the recording and of course did not add my baggage for free. I did however requested both calls (the one asking for 100euros and the second one when they asked for more money and did not add my baggage) I am waiting for the response. On the 2nd of August, I flew from Athens to Heraklion. There was about a 2-hour delay and the airline offered us a free ticket. However, they state that I cannot use the free ticket during Christmas, Easter, July and August but as I live in the UK and I am not allowed to use it the only periods that I can travel to Greece.

,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,Jan-22,31st January 2022,3,2,1,Ireland,3,no,"I booked my flight to Calgary (Aer Lingus EI105 - 11:35AM + WestJet WS1681 via JFK New York) with Trip.com. I checked the COVID test requirements for Canada (my final destination) in the days leading to my flight and read that I needed to have a negative PCR done within 72 hours of flying. This I did 2 days pre-flight. When I arrived at the airport at 8:00AM, the Aer Lingus check in staff queried my COVID certificate, but I told her that my final destination was Canada, not US, and I was told that my COVID certificate was then ""fine"". My baggage was checked in, I got through security, US customs and border protection, and all the way I proceeded to the boarding gate. When I approached the boarding gate staff at 10:40AM, I was asked to fill out a form for US clearance stating that I had a negative test within the last 24 hours. I couldn’t sign this and told the ground attendant that my final destination was Canada. He told me to wait aside. After all the other passengers have been boarded, he told me that I could not board the flight to New York since I didn’t have a negative test taken within the previous 24 hours. At that stage, it was then too late for me to get an antigen test. The other ground attendant told me the luggage would be off-loaded and I will have to collect them in carousel 6. He tried to rebook my flight, but since I had booked with Trip.com, he said I should contact the travel agency as he couldn’t change it. I was escorted to the exit leading to baggage reclaim and told “You know if you hadn’t said anything, we would have never noticed it. That’s what you get for being so honest.” I contacted Trip.com and the rep said she will forward an urgent flight change request to Aer Lingus. I then got an email stating “the airline said that according to the policy they cannot operate the change. Your ticket is non-changeable after departure, it is all up to the airline company.” At that stage, my options being extremely limited, I rebooked my flights to Calgary at a cost of 644 euro plus I had to get another PCR test for 69 euro. I managed to fly next day but to add insult to injury, all the luggage that I paid for went missing and did not arrive with me.  If I had been told at check-in on my original flight that my COVID cert was invalid for the US, and if my luggage had not been checked through, I would have had time to get a negative antigen test, I wouldn’t have been denied boarding and wouldn’t have incurred the extra expense (644 euro flight + 69 euro PCT test).  I have written to Aer Lingus and they initially ""offered"" to refund the flight. However, that also seemed to be the end of the conversation from them. I submitted multiple follow-up requests using their case update portal but haven't received a single response since then. Trip.com will refund me but they cannot proceed as Aer Lingus has not refunded them yet. What happened to me was an avoidable mistake by the ground attendants at the airport.

Then repeat the process to get back. To top it off while we paid $431.33 for the original ticket.

I'll have to start with the fact that they let you have a checked in bag which weighs up to a certain amount of kilos for free, which as far as I'm concerned is not the case for many airlines. Flight was initially delayed by half an hour or so which for me wasn't a lot as I didn't have any connecting flights to worry about, but I understand that for some people this might not be the case. Boarding was done via jetbridge and was rather fast considering the flight was full. We boarded the plane, but didn't take off for nearly another two hours due to a thunderstorm over the airport. The seats were very comfortable for Economy class, but again I'm only 1.62 so my opinion on this probably isn't relevant. The pilots made an announcement straight away and the flight attendants handed out free drinks to everyone during the time we spent on the ground. The pilots kept informing us of the situation and when we finally took off the flight was extremely turbulent, but they handled the situation pretty well I must say. A free hot meal was provided for all passengers, both Bussiness and Economy class which is very rare these days for an intra-european flight. When we arrived in Athens the pilots made an apology for the delay and announced that every passenger who had missed their connecting flight would be offered either a free rebooking or a voucher but I can't remember exactly, as I didn't need one. Luggage came out quickly and it wasn't damaged in any way. The price was ok but considering their excellent service I can't even think about complaining about the price. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that there was no in flight entertaining as there were no screens which having flown on their A320s as well I know are present there, but not in the A321, but again, I'm not complaining.

I got my suitcase back 13 days later and they ignored every attempt I made to get my interim expenses reimbursed (they were very modest). I had to travel on to Switzerland for a week without clothes and underwear. On the 19th, their inflight crew was ""illegal"" and so the flight was delayed 90"", and so I missed my train connexion and had to purchase a new ticket for 39€. I asked for a reimbursement, but at least this time they answered and told me NO! It wasn't three hours so I am out of luck, and they had the moxie to write me, ""We sincerely hope that you will accept our apologies and hope that you will continue to place your confidence in us.""

In July of 2020 I bought a round-trip ticket London-Cancun for a friend for travel in August. Three days later they cancelled their London-Mexico City flights for the entire month of August. I called to find an alternative, but they couldn't offer me anything, save for travel credit. When I said I wanted a refund, the agent said I'd have to write to a dedicated email address. The email was returned as undeliverable, so I opened a dispute through my credit card, figuring I'd get my money back that way. AeroMexico objected to the dispute, saying my fare was non-refundable they said I had credit to use within a year, minus a $200 no-show fee. A no-show fee for a cancelled flight. When I finally fixed the problem with their email address, they said that since I bought the ticket through a third party vendor (in this case Orbitz) I'd have to get the refund through them. Orbitz was helpful, but said they still had to go through AeroMexico for their approval before issuing a refund. Months went by, and all Orbitz could say was that the airlines are very slow these days and AeroMexico was not responding. So they have the manpower to object to my credit card dispute and keep my money, just not the manpower to approve my refund. I wrote to them several times about this discrepancy, but they never addressed that issue, just repeating I'd have to go through Orbitz. Let me add, I tried to be understanding. I can see that the airlines are strapped. I said I would accept credit in place of a refund if I could change the name of the passenger (which the rules disallow remember I got this for a friend) and if the credit were not time restricted (which, so far as I can see, just helps them out even more). They said they could not do that because their policies do not allow it. Of course, their policies are under their control.

Other than this, several other experiences have negatively affected my opinion. Recently my girlfriends bags were lost by Air Berlin (for the second time), and they promised she would get a refund for everything. We even called the support to make sure. However, all she got was a coupon to use when booking flights through the AB website. The value of the coupon was 1/3 of what the clothes cost. As for my personal experiences, a few months ago I missed a connecting flight because of the first flight was delayed.

The segments from Abu Dhabi were operated by Etihad Airways and the rest was operated by Air Berlin. Checked in online, but when we arrived at the airport we found out, that our seats from Abu Dhabi to Phuket had been reassigned to other passengers. Reason was, that Air Berlin can not access the Etihad Airways booking system. Hence our boarding passes were invalid and we did not get any window seats any more. Apart from that however, check in procedures were smooth and seamless. Air Berlin offers their XL seats (economy seats with more legroom) for free to their frequent flyers and I have to say, that I love them. They are exactly what I was looking after. I do not need any premium economy product where the food is the same but only presented differently. I get extra baggage allowance and other benefits from my frequent flyer status. So the extra legroom is really valuable to me. Even if I didn't get it for free, I would be more than willing to pay those 79€. The extra space allows you to stretch your legs and to find comfortable and relaxing position for a long haul flight. Boarding was done in an efficient way and we were able to take off on time. Pillows and blankets were distributed in advance, whereas the amenity kits (toothbrush, sleeping mask, ear plugs) were distributed after we were airborne.

The weather was bad, so after two scary attempts to land us in Boston, they landed us in a small airport in Hartford, CT instead. This is fine-being safe. Once there, they sent a representative to talk to us. They were going to bus us to Boston, MA, which would mean my connecting flight to Raleigh would be missed (I had booked this separately). I spoke to their representative numerous times. (Oh and they had lost one piece of my luggage too, which they were able to find a few days later). The plan from Aer Lingus was to bus us to Boston and we would arrive between 1 and 2 in the morning. We were told that the airport would then be closed, but we might be able to get a cab to a nearby hotel, but they were not sure if any were running. Their plan was to dump us outside of Boston Airport at 1 or 2 in the morning. Remember, this is after 2 extremely turbulent attempted landings and a diversion to a different airport. I asked if they could put us up in the Hartford Airport hotel instead. I was told yes and that I would be reimbursed, but the fastest way was to pay it myself and ask for reimbursement later. I also asked about having to rebook my connecting flight that was missed, and was told yes, it would be reimbursed. I was lucky enough to have enough to pay for an unexpected hotel and extra flight, but not everyone may have been so lucky. I filed a request for a reimbursement through Aer Lingus website as told to do. It took over a month for a response and was told that they could not help me because I showed them bank statements and no the original receipts. I got the original receipts and sent them in. I was denied at that point because ""there responsibility was to get me to Boston, not to pay for connecting flights or hotels."" So-even though I was told directly by their representative that I would be reimbursed, and that their plan was to drop us off at a wintry cold airport at 1 or 2 in the morning with no accommodations, they feel they held up their end of the deal.

The seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate. Following a welcome Champagne drink and hot towel, the menus were handed out.

Although there was a choice of three main courses, I was told they had only one choice for dinner and breakfast left!  For dinner,  small appetisers were served, followed by a seafood starter, salad and hot breads. The main fish course was OK but a little bland. However, a desert trolley came along and I was able to choose what I liked, and settled for cheese/crackers and ice cream. Plenty to eat, but not that great. The wine served was good, and topped up several times, before coffee and cognac. One of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food, but it was not a major issue. What impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew. I have read negative reviews about Air China complaining about the lack of English spoken. But for me, that is the charm of communicating with others who may not be so perfect in other languages. I really enjoyed my flight, especially the friendly cabin crew.

Almaty-Astana-Moscow on A320. Food is tasty. Good choice of drinks including alcohol. Entertainment is outdated - just magazines music and a movie. Both flights on time. Smooth landings. We checked our baggage straight from Beijing to Moscow. It was a bit risky with 2 stop-overs but the airline staff assisted us in Kazakhstan and checked if the bags followed us.

They did not even offer to refund the money paid for the ticket, as they must do by law. Rather, the cancellation message said that we could have an open ticket to any destination.  To this date (December 23rd), Aeromexico has neither refunded the ticket price nor honored their offer for an open ticket. All I get when I call the airline are lies and more lies -- first, they said that the money had already been refunded, and then that I would get a voucher for 115% of the ticket price, but none of that is true. The airline's latest communication was to send us a notice informing us that our claim was subject to their bankruptcy proceeding in New York. Yet another lie - that proceeding does not affect any claim against the airline that was created after June 30, 2020. They'll probably also claim that the flight cancellation was caused by Covid, although they sold the ticket and cancelled the flight in August, well after they knew all about the pandemic's effect on air travel.

,Aegean Airlines,Economy Class,Jan-20,18th January 2020,0,4,1,UnitedKingdom,4,no,"Frankfurt to Athens. It might be my impression but it feels like the legroom has been reduced, seats are awful and  uncomfortable. The customer service is  average along with the cleanliness of the aircraft. As long as the flight is fully booked the land crew requests from clients to board with just the hand luggage and deliver the carry-on luggage to the hold (free of charge as they claim). This review was written with the value-for-money in mind as the primary factor. Hence there is no reason at all booking the tickets with Aegean if you are about to pay more and receive the same legroom and seat-comfort to any other low-cost flying company Since Aegean allows its passengers to fly in Economy/Go-Light with the standard carry-on luggage and handbag allowance (as stated on their ticket), they should adhere to that. The reason passengers do that is because it allows them to quickly grab their bags and catch the next flight without having to wait on the belt to retrieve luggage. I agree with the company's policy to weigh/measure the carry-on luggage prior to boarding in order to filter any passengers carrying excessive carry-ons. However as long as the passenger is compliant  they shouldn't force him/her deliver their carry-on to the hold. I am a Silver member over the past 3 years and during this flight I requested for my ticket to be upgraded. However the representative assured me that I wasn't able since the flight was in cooperation with Lufthansa. When I asked to upgrade only the ticket from Frankfurt to Athens (operated by Aegean) they declined providing me the same reason.

He then advised me to wait until 24 hours before my flight to do this as there was a chance I could get my money back in the event that the flight was cancelled.

We arrived at the airport 7:30 a.m. and stood in line until the check in agent opened at 9:00 a.m. I was the only one there standing in line as I wanted to beat the crowd. We checked in and went to security and they said our flight had been cancelled. Went back to agent and she said ""No"" flight had not been cancelled and the security were mistaken. We went back to security with some airline person with us and went through. We tried to find out which gate our flight was at and it was not listed. We finally found an Air Berlin agent at another gate. They said they could not help me as they could ""only see their own flight on their computer screen"". I persisted and finally they checked and said to go to gate 23 which we had been at. No one was there and it was 20 minutes until boarding. We left and started searching for some other help. After at least 2 attempts with various agents (not Air Berlin as they are not at that airport) our flight had been cancelled prior to our arriving at the airport. Air Berlin did not contact us about that. Air Berlin had transferred our reservations to British Airways but no one had told us. We went to British Airways (BA). We were fortunate to ask for help from an airport employee who walked us to various agent windows talking to them in English and Dutch and finally got us some answers. All of this is over a multi hour period of time. We found out from BA that when Air Berlin had made the reservations they had failed to make arrangements for the seating requirements we had paid for (aisle seat, extra leg room as one of us has medical conditions that require this). British Airways said they could not make any changes to our tickets from London to the USA until we landed in London. That is a whole other story as that was difficult and stressful even though BA was working with us; it was just too late to make many changes on an already ""booked flight"". BA were finally able to make the needed changes but it took much time and was a devastating experience due to the failures of Air Berlin. In each airport we tried to speak to Air Berlin, London Heathrow and LAX, there were no Air Berlin employees at that time. Our luggage is lost and Air Berlin did not provide any ""claim checks"" to us so we are sitting here now, not knowing where our luggage is (Air Berlin told us that it was already on the BA flight which was not true) or if we will ever see it again as we have no claim check tickets.

Best value for money: what caused me to book was the offer of flying a flat bed C-class seat from JFK to Shanghai for $2,200 (return tkt), only with a quick stopover of 90 minutes in PEK. Pre-flight concerns: - I kept receiving automated emails from the airline that my itinerary has changed and that I should contact them and I can change/get a refund for my tkt. The small change that happened once was a 5 minute change in departure time which increased my layover in PEK (good thing, since you need those 90 minute to transfer) - customer service: it's impossible to reach them by phone, the line is not manned. So I emailed them. They responded within 24hrs (or so) and said that my flight's transfer time in PEK is too short and my tkt needs to be changed. But when I went online I saw that my same exact flight itinerary was still being sold on various websites, incl. airchina.us. - The inconsistent response from their customer service really got me worried about the reliability of this airline, so I did some more research online on helpful reviews. I mostly read terrible reviews on how delayed the flights were, people missing their connections and being treated very poorly. That's when I got really worried about having booked this ticket, but figured I will take the risk. Also TPG wrote a fairly good review on them, so that felt comforting. Flight: - Outbound: upper deck of Boeing 747, half empty cabin. Seat was perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was smooth, food was good/fine - meat a bit chewy. Staff are friendly and helpful, though be aware they only speak limited english. - Inbound: Boeing 777-300 - full cabin. Seat perfectly comfortable (flat bed). Service was great, they accommodated my specific food requests despite not having ordered in advance. Overall a great flying experience. - All flights were pretty much on time - In-flight entertainment is ok, limited movies selection / limited music selection - no WIFI. Transfers in PEK: - 90 minutes is definitely needed if transferring. You need to take a quick 'airtrain' trip from domestic to intl., even if you don't change Terminals. The connecting flight to and from SHA was a tarmac parked aircraft with bus transfers, so that added time as well.

The night before our flight we could only check in my husband and myself, it was giving us a note that we needed to come see someone at the counter upon arriving to the airport. We went very early the next day, try to check in our daughters again and the same notice came up. So we went to find out what the issue was and a guy at customer service very rude and unpleasant, notify us like nothing that the two tickets for our daughters were sold out to their own staff. I could NOT understand what was happening at the same time and why would they do that to tickets that were already paid 4 months ahead of time. Anyways after arguing and actually crying we had to leave our two daughters behind waiting there to get accommodations for the next day on the evening. With the loss of two days of their flights and my agony as a mother we left them behind. Because they could not accommodate all of us on the same flights now because everything was sold out. We wrote to Air Canada a complaint and the excuse was because of the weather their flight was delay. Not knowing that we already knew that the tickets were re-sold to accommodate their own employees.

I booked this last minute due to Air Berlin going bankrupt and cancelling our flights. Had some hesitation, but overall I had a good experience. Premium economy rate was reasonable, however seat choice was problematic. The recline was adequate, but could have used higher feet elevation. Staff were attentive and friendly. I packed enough essential items on my carry ons in case the actual luggage got lost, since so many complaints of losing luggage, ours arrived on our destinations just fine. They are Very strict on weight of luggage, they will weigh the carry ons 10 kg max each and the regular luggage 23 kg max, I almost had a problem in Venice. My husband and I were allowed 2 check in each total of 4, we were checking in only 3 so we had ample extra but I packed the bags 24 kg, 25 kg, 15 kg. They insisted to move the luggage around even though we could have more. So make sure to pack under each suitcase. The food in flight was delicious, they had sea bass, halibut, beef brisket,etc. Even for 3 or 4 hr flight they served a full meal. However, they serve the drinks first, so don't finish the drinks or ask for 2,if you like drinking during your meals. The movie selection was adequate, the headphones are 2 prong, they only distribute once the plane is in flight so bring your own if you have one. There is a USB charger. People bring pets in the plane, small dogs,etc. The lady next to me wanted to put her dog by my foot, and I refused, they should be made to buy business class for more space, plus she put her dirty, bare foot on the food tray to elevate, which was gross, and she ate there! At the airport they sometimes bus you to the smaller planes, and it is cold! Bring warm clothing, thick jacket, scarf, hat. The waiting room in Moscow airport are small, I would find an empty waiting area and head to our terminal once we are closer to boarding.

When we were queuing to board the plane we were called to one side and told the flight had been overbooked and as we had the longest connection time in Moscow we had to wait until the flight the following morning. We were put in a nearby hotel and went back to Heathrow in the morning and got on the next flight. On Aeroflot flights there's minimal drinks on offer, water, orange juice, or wine out of a paper cup. The food is okay, and the seat comfort average. When we landed in Hanoi we found out our bags had not come on the flight with us but the staff did not know where they were, nor could they tell us how long they would take to reach us. This is a huge problem when you're travelling around Vietnam for a month and in two days would be 1000 miles away from Hanoi where the bags would be delivered. We were given a number to call to check on the status of our bags but every time we phoned we were not given any information. A week later we were told our bags had been found. We arranged for them to be sent to hoi an where we picked them up. Absolutely no compensation from the airline, not even an apology. On our return flight our flight was delayed by 5 hours which meant we missed our connection. This would have been okay if Aeroflot arranged a hotel for us until the next flight the following morning.

We were then told another rep would arrange our accommodation at midnight, the time now was 9pm. By midnight there was no sign of any rep. Other frustrated passengers started demanding information from the staff that were around but it was no use. At 3am we gave up and went to the gate to wait for 4 hours.

I am trying to avoid Air Berlin as best as I can - due to their bad service and punctuality record and inferior cabin product compared to Eurowings, Lufthansa, Swiss and even Easyjet. But for an afternoon flight from the Dusseldorf region to Milano, AB8746 at 15.35 is the only option. Having taken this flight twice in less than 2 months, it really leaves me angry to again experience significant delay of almost 1 hour for this flight on 1 September - for my previous flight on 7 July it was 40 mins. While the airline sent a message by email (that I missed), Dusseldorf airport provided no information about the delay. Also, the gate staff only announces the delay 15 mins prior to departure? Surely, the airport should have known for at least 2 hours. Studying the departure boards, I see that Air Berlin had to cancel two flights (Munich and Stockholm). So maybe I should count myself ""lucky"" to only be delayed.

,Air Berlin,Economy Class,Jul-16,1st September 2016,0,0,1,Australia,1,no,"✅ , |  Munich to Berlin. Flight and plane were fine and normal, however I did find the seats a bit cramped. The problem came on landing. We had flown from Dubai and our luggage transferred to the Air Berlin flight 6196. When we got off in Berlin it was not marked where to go so we followed others who were walking out. Just at the exit doors I noticed we were exiting and asked the guard where to go for luggage. He only said ""go to Terminal C lost baggage"". Once you are just 1 inch out the sliding door you can not go back to get your baggage. Ok follow policy blindly with no common sense, thats what EU is all about I guess. Once at the lost baggage it was chaos as about 20 airlines had turned over their lost baggage to a 3rd party company called WISAG. It took one hr in line to reach a man who only said ""go file a claim on line"" thats it. ""Go use the iPad over there"". The lady ahead of us was German and was totally outraged and the SA man being us in line had also done the very same thing too. The next day we came back and again after 1 hr in line they looked at the screen and said ""Nope its not listed here"" and ""we still have 18 carts not yet unloaded back there from last week"". We then went up to the Air Berlin counter in the terminal and they just looked at us with a blank who cares look and said ""go back to lost luggage"" thats all, no help at all. They did not care in the least.  We went back again at 11 pm and finally got one of the men (there were ever only 2 there) who took some compassion on us when I said 'my wife cancer drugs were in her bag and our tour group left tomorrow'. He said ""maybe I saw them yesterday"" and he actually went back and found them. We had been in a state of despair what to do, totaly zero information or help by anyone at Air Berlin.

Attitude of the ground staff was that they do not actually care - in their words ""we can do nothing with it"". It is OK when the system screws it up but then I expect staff to work towards the customer service, not to let a 2 years old sit alone. In the end we solved it ourselves on the plane thanks to other nice passengers but again Air China staff didn't helped much. Overall service and quality of plane was as well poor.

They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble.

Unfortunately due to the COVID outbreak we were starting to reconsider the trip and called customer service to inquire about our options. We contacted Aeroméxico in March to request a refund (over $3,000CAD). We were directed not to be haste and to hold on for a while longer, until we were closer to the departure date. On May 21st we called again Aeroméxico, requesting a refund for the 4 round flight tickets and we were informed, that unfortunately that would not be possible. The gentleman was very courteous, acknowledged our feelings and explained their policies regarding a refund. He then proceeded to inform us that Aeroméxico would, however, allow us to reissue the tickets for a later date however, the flights would have to be rescheduled for a date no later than April 30th, 2020. At that point I e-mailed several letters to Aeroméxico Customer Service department and requested them to please extend the vouchers deadline (provided them with a time frame that would work for us) and explained valid reasons why we would not be able to travel within the time frame given. We also stated the reasons why we would not be able to travel this July. In my letter I also mentioned that I have been a frequent costumer and I have always enjoyed traveling with their airline and would like to continue to be a loyal customer. (We love Mexico and we love to travel there.) At the end, they stated that they appreciated our patience in resolving the matter and have extended our voucher's validity to our satisfaction. Would we have like a refund? Yes, of course! However, we tend to forget that everyone has been affected by the COVID pandemic, even big corporations have lost and are continuing to lose billions of dollars due to this unprecedented situation. All of us need to be united, understanding and try to find a compromise in which both parties will be pleased with the outcome.

,Aer Lingus,Business Class,Mar-20,6th May 2020,3,2,1,Ireland,2,no,"I booked my flights through Aer Lingus and put in the bids for upgrades. The first flight out was on 12th  march and the upgrade bid was accepted and paid for. Unfortunately within a few days of travel the holiday was cancelled and we were advised to return home. Aer Lingus offered free change of flight but price difference would apply. The change function on the website and app were not working. I received a message telling me to contact direct by phone. I was surprised by this in such an age of automation, and a little disappointed. But I was given no other option by Aer Lingus. I called as advised and was on hold for a full 2 hours, I then spoke to an agent who advised my change of flights would be €435 as this represented the fare difference. I accepted and was asked to wait so he could set up payment, then he hung up without taking payment. I was not called or contacted by this agent despite him confirming my phone and email details. So I called again, and again on hold, this went on for 90 minutes when again, having not spoken to an agent, the line was hung up. I called again and after 1 hour the same occurred. That now made it close to 5 hours and no change of flights possible, the frustration at this lack of basic functionality in such a company I found staggering. With the global situation going from bad to worse and the fear of being trapped in the states with no medical insurance and all the other problems a lock down or illness would bring, we had no choice but to book completely different flights to get us home. Again we went with Aer Lingus and this cost us €1577.76. Although I was glad I could get us home, and in the knowledge that I did not have to use Aer Lingus again, despite being so frustrated at the lack of service, I did. But would have been a lot happier if the same ease to book new flights could have been matched by the process for changing existing flights. I received a mail 18th of March to say that I could cancel my flights for the 23rd and would receive a credit in the way of a flight credit plus 10%, again I would have preferred a refund but, was happy to cancel the flight and take the credit to be used later. Then I received a mail to say that my upgrade for my cancelled flight home had been approved and a further €980 had been debited to my card. I now make that a total of €2,5557.76 that I have paid Aer Lingus for flights I should have been able to change for €435.

My last flights, AB 8746 in July from Düsseldorf to Milan and AB 8731 in 13 June from Milan to Berlin were delayed. Communication with AB is difficult, waiting times at the hotline can be over 15 mins - only to speak to badly trained staff. On Sunday 12 June (I had an email informing me of a cancellation of my direct LIN - TXL flight for 13 June), I had to call the hotline three times to find alternative ways of getting to Berlin (in this case via Vienna). I ended up being double booked - hence the many calls. As a OneWorld Sapphire member (through BA), I am also frustrated that AB is gotten worse in seat selection. While not so long ago, a Sapphire member would get priority seats, this is not the case anymore and seats can only be booked from row 15. So, as it happens, on flight AB 8476 on 7 July, rows 3-14 were almost completely empty. Seating is also really bad and cramped - not more difference to Ryanair. On 7 July, the plane was not cleaned properly, maybe to make up for the delay of 40 mins? Another ""policy!"" to alienate frequent and business travellers is the restrictive hand luggage check before security at some German airports. I would understand if AB was a low-cost airline trying to make some more money by passengers checking in luggage. However, AB is still charging tariffs closer to Lufthansa than Easyjet or Ryanair, so it should at least try and show more flexibility for its passengers, particularly business travellers.

The airline did not load my luggage on to the connecting flight in Moscow not once, but twice - on both my outward and return journeys. I flew to Tokyo from Heathrow with a stopover in Moscow. Unfortunately, the first leg of the flight was delayed by an hour or so (with no reason given). As a result, I was rushed through the airport in Moscow and was frantically ushered on to my connection. When I arrived in Tokyo Narita I was informed that my case was still in Moscow. It was two days before I received it at the address I was staying at. I did consider the idea that this could happen again on my return journey three weeks later, but surely not? Oh yes it could. This time there were no delays, yet when I returned to London I was told that my bag was still in Moscow and could take a day or two to be delivered to me. I was given a number to call that looked suspiciously like a mobile number and told that they could not guarantee when I got my bag back. Early the next morning, I tried to call to find out where my bag was. The number given went straight to voicemail. I tried to call it several times, but still nothing. I then tried to call the baggage customer helplines. All three numbers were busy and I didn't succeed in getting through to anyone over a five hour period. Calling the baggage handler responsible for Aeroflot at Heathrow was also useless, and they passed me another mobile number that also didn't answer. I then tried calling the Aeroflot desk at Heathrow, and was grateful to speak to a human being.

A332 / DH8D,Air Berlin,Economy Class,May-16,14th July 2016,3,4,3,UnitedStates,7,yes,"New York JFK to Krakow via Berlin with Air Berlin. Because of the short layover time, and the affordability of the tickets, it proved to be our best option as it was only slightly longer than a direct flight. We took the overnight flight from JFK to TXL on an A332, flying in economy. We made sure to get to the Airport very early, but check in was very quick and smooth, so we had ample time to do everything we needed to do. Our flight out was delayed for about 50 minutes, which is typical of almost any flight out of JFK, but because of our short layover in Berlin (just under 2 hours, plus having to go through customs) this did worry us. We were only able to get center aisle seats. The seats themselves, while comfortable to sit in, did not offer much leg room for someone like me who is 6'3"" so the long haul flight was a bit uncomfortable in the later hours. The entertainment screens on our seats seemed to work, but not very well, but we tried to sleep much of the flight, so we did not fidget with it too much. The flight included diner after take off, and a light breakfast before landing. Meal was better than one would expect for economy class airline food. Staff was very attentive and friendly. We arrived in Berlin about an hour behind schedule, and because of this, the airline made a point to find anyone who had a short connection and move the up in the customs line, so they could catch their next flight. We were a bit worried, especially since we had to connect in a different terminal (and this meant going back through security at TXL). Luckily, everything moved quite quickly (German efficiency) and we made it to our connection gate with 25 minutes to spare before boarding. The second leg, was a short flight from TXL to Krakow. This was on a smaller turbo prop plane, a DC-H8. While the plane felt a bit older on the inside than the A330 we had just flown on, the leg room was much, much better. We had seats on the wing, just behind the props, but we didn't find this to be any louder than a normal flight. The flight itself was nice, and as before, the flight staff was friendly. Overall, we were very satisfied with our flight and our experience. Our only issue was on our return flight. A few days before we were scheduled to leave, we had a death in the family. This would require us to stay a few days later. Our ticket package did not allow for rebooking, but I was hoping they could work with us with options on what we could try to do. Unfortunately, they offered none, and the person I talked to did not seem interested in going further than telling me, 'There is nothing we can do for you.' Given the circumstances, I was hoping we could have figured out something, but instead, we had to book a flight through another airline (which ended up being cheaper than what it would have cost to book the return through Air Berlin).

,Air China,Economy Class,Aug-19,28th September 2019,1,1,1,Australia,1,no,"Islamabad to Melbourne via Beijing. My overall experience was horrible. Air China may be good value for money but be prepared for all the troubles and headaches that you will face with this airline from their uncomfortable seats, not working monitors, stained and smelly seat covers, delayed departure (one day) to loss of baggage. With Air China you are like a guinea pig you don't know where the flight is taking you, you cannot communicate with anyone in China if you don't speak Chinese. Long story short - flight took off to get passengers from Karachi but diverted back being 5mins to land to Islamabad and finally took off again one day late from the city of origin Islamabad, arrived one day late in Beijing (transit) of course the connecting flight was missed because of the airline. Failed to accommodate me or compensate for anything - just gave 350 CNY = $50 AUD to spend 13 hours in Beijing airport. Resting charge minimum starts 180 CNY per hour and 165 CNY to take a shower. My luggage had to stay in Beijing as I couldn't pass through customs, the airline failed to get me my luggage and asked me to claim it lost when I get home while my luggage was one floor away. Spent 13 hours on a bench in Beijing then they arranged for me to take a flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne as there were no flights for the next 3 days from Beijing itself (according to airline) however there were many flights. So all the way to Hong Kong the airport closed while we were in the air - I understand the situation but Air China lands in a city (Shenzhen) where they don't have any staff, any counter, any office or anything related to Air China. So I was again stuck in Shenzhen immigration. Immigration was forcing me to contact the airline, on many attempts by using the officer's phone I failed to get through, the immigration gave up and forced me to buy the earliest flight possible from Shenzhen to get out of the airport. For 12 hours stuck in 3x3 meter spot, no one from Ari China showed up to help or look for the passenger who is their responsibility to arrange accommodation for and arrange the flights for. After 12 hours Shenzhen immigration officers forces me to buy a ticket and claim it back from Air China as we did not hear anything from them. Coming back home after and seeking reimbursement, took 45 days Air China offered TCV Transportation Credit Voucher to spend only with Air China within 12 months. Like are you kidding me, this travel I had was after 3 years and I know for the next 2 years I am not traveling anywhere so their TCV meant nothing but gas and air, after telling them I will not be traveling for the next 12 months they suggest I give the TCV to a friend or family. Like seriously is this some sort of a joke. I was forced to buy another ticket twice more expensive than the entire return trip while I had already paid for one and Air China failed to provide any assistance and service for, they ask me to pass the voucher to family and friend. I earned that money, it is a whole month worth of rent to pay here in Australia and they ask me to pass it to a family or friend. None of my friends or family would ever travel with an irresponsible airline after what I had been through took me 4 days to get home (Melbourne). I do not recommend anyone to fly with Air China.

I flew out from Toronto (YYZ) to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on June 22, 2022, Flight 1628. To begin with, as sprawling as Pearson Airport is the signage is lacking and honestly not clear at all, so it was extremely confusing to figure out exactly where we needed to go just to check in for our specific flight. Air Canada's ground customer service was painfully slow and inefficient - I get there are staffing shortages with the pandemic aftermath, but this was a little excessive. Our flight boarded a few minutes behind schedule which wasn't the end of the world, but we were scheduled to take off at 4.45pm and did not take off until almost 7.00pm! All of us literally sat on the tarmac going nowhere for over 2 hours! The cabin crew was essentially clueless and the pilot kept giving one excuse after another for the delay which didn't even make sense. Every passenger was pretty agitated about the situation, to say the least...we finally took off way behind schedule and did not make it into Fort Lauderdale until almost 10.00pm (original landing time was 7.45pm). The flight itself was OK. At least on AC Rouge, I found the legroom to be mediocre, and the seating marginally comfortable. Flight attendants were generally polite, but not necessarily friendly. Overall, this is my second experience flying Air Canada.

Being born in Russia, I have been always proud of Russian hospitality and the high quality of service. Unfortunately, each Aeroflot flight undermines my pride. I have been dissapointed, when my flight Moscow to Yerevan was cancelled without any prior announcement. I was waiting in Sheremetyevo to check-in my luggage (only two counters were opened for international flight passengers) just to find out that my flight is cancelled. However, one can see ""on time"" mark on the timetable. My husband was at that time flying to Moscow from Berlin to catch the same flight. Dut to the weather conditions, I expected the cancellation to happen, but what happened next, demonstrates the complete lack of Aeroflot`s ability to organize the passenger flow in such situations. My husband eventually got stuck in the transit zone with the flight information ""on time"", no Aeroflot personnel and people, who were sleeping on the mattresses! He found an Aeroflot representative only after an hour of running through different terminals of Sheremetyevo airport. At the same time I was literally fighting to get the same-day-flight to Yerevan (2 ladies at the counter for over 200 passengers), while the Aeroflot representative was extremely impolite and borderline offensive. Eventually, I got a flight 3 hours later (which got delayed for 3 more hours), and my husband managed to get a flight 3 hours (plus 1 hour delay) after my delayed flight. Waiting time at Sheremetyevo was more than 10 hours. We could not even fly together. They still had seats but they pointed out that it ""is too difficult for them"". No food or hotel were provided, not even a bottle of water. Anyway, the whole time all I wanted to hear was: ""We are sorry for your inconvenience. Your possible options would be"".

After they had cancelled my flight, I called them, and found they were unable to accommodate me in a flight from Geneva, which they serve, and is the nearest location they serve that's accessible by train. Also my understanding is they would have charged me any fare difference for such a flight. RyanAir saved me in this situation with a direct flight to Dublin, and honestly they are leagues beyond Aer Lingus in terms of response to the COVID situation.

It is astounding that Aer Lingus is not allowing people who have existing bookings (ours is for tomorrow - Mar. 11) to change them without the per person / per direction change fee, which is not cheap. They have announced that new bookings can be changed with no fee, but are not making this policy change retroactive. I'm not even asking for a refund - a credit for 12 months would be acceptable.

My partner and I originally booked a convenient 1½-hour afternoon flight within Europe. Air Berlin then cancelled the flight and changed our itinerary (in fact, changed it twice) so that in the end it involved an early-morning departure and a 5-hour journey via a city in the opposite direction. The e-mails they sent about this were weird and confusing. We were going to simply cancel the flight, but when I contacted Air Berlin they said that they would at least reimburse the cost of staying at an airport hotel the night before, so we agreed. But then, after the flight, they refused to make the reimbursement. Instead they offered me a voucher, which I just find insulting - why on earth would I want to book with them again? I fly a lot with budget airlines, and of course have experienced plenty of delays and frustrations over the years, but have never before felt that an airline has deliberately chosen to treat me badly.

I was notified by my travel agent initially via email and apparently, was extremely shocked. I then phoned the agent but to no avail and given that there was no after-hour support in my region, I called their reservations hotline in Russia, only to find that some of their staff did not even speak comprehensible English. To complicate things, they denied the reservations code they themselves supplied, claiming that there was no numbers but only letters, when it clearly contained 2 numbers! After a rather unproductive 5-minute conversation where the staff kept prompting me to repeat and verify the reference code, they asked me for the ticket number. Guess what? They then forwarded me to another service agent, kind of implying it was a special case and they couldn't handle it. When I was finally connected, I was asked to supply the reference code again and they once again said their reference codes do not contain numbers. Of course, that member of staff also ended up asking me to quote the ticket number and sounded hugely impatient when I said ""hold on let me retrieve it"" with a long and deep breath. Mind you, it took me less than 15 seconds to retrieve it. When I finally started quoting the number, that staff member did not respond until I repeated a few times the first 6 digits and the deafening silence caused me to think the call was interrupted. Yet, after a few ""hellos"" he finally went ""CONTINUE!"" and that was one of the most impolite commands I'd ever encountered in phone conversations with airline personnel! To make things worse, he then said he needed to check my booking details further and put me on hold without even saying anything like ""please hold the line"".

On two days the supervisors suggested I call back to speak with them on the following day to see if they would allow us to take an earlier flight to make our connections. Both times I called back at the suggested time and both of the names they had given me were unknown to anyone at the Houston call center. If they make a two hour or greater change their inflexible policy is only then accommodation is possible! They know exactly what they are doing to generate extra revenue. We were forced to buy an earlier flight at higher cost and they got to re-sell our now later flight a second time above my earlier booked price. We were held hostage in Mexico until we paid up or being trapped in Mexico City if we missed our flight home due to their change in departure time. They well knew this would impact many people on a large flight north. Result was that the inexpensive original return flight turned into double price for the earlier departure at premium (2 base cost +4 -premium double price equal 6 times the cost for a two hour flight and then their ability to resell my later flight seats a premium - a big $ money maker for AeroMexico.

This was not the problem because all flights seemed to be delayed. The first problem was check in, we could not check in ahead of time because of a lack of access to the internet but we had to check our bags anyway. We were 2nd in line to check in, 20 minutes to get to the desk to check in. The employees were non-communicative about the delay in the process. Boarding was chaos. There was an additional delay in Berlin, not a problem, we figured it would give them time to load our luggage from the previous flight. Not one bag was unloaded from the plane in Frankfurt. An entire plane full of luggage was lost? They let us wait at the carousel at 1am for over 30 minutes before it was announced that all passengers must fill out a lost luggage form. It was chaos there too, people pushing and shoving to get a paper at the desk, they didn't have enough for everyone. 2 days after landing my husband finally reached someone who told him none of the luggage was loaded on the plane. I have 2 problems with this: 1) If they knew they didn't load any luggage on the plane, why didn't they give the passengers the lost luggage paper on the plane to fill out during the flight? That would have spared us another hour at the airport. 2) It seems that it was more likely that the airport workers decided not to off load the plane. We finally get our luggage 2.5 days later.

The notation on the display boards indicated that it was still boarding but it had departed by the time I got to the gate. I feel that the airlines must know that there are people wanting to connect on any fight and know which flights are delayed and which flights are arriving, therefore could have waited about 15 minutes to half an hour longer.

In compare with, for example, Finnair business class with fewer seats in a row, the Aeroflot B777 seats offer little less privacy, because they are closer to the aisle, but the width of the seat itself is good. Considering the lower price of the Aeroflot business class ticket, it's a very good deal. Nice detail: a pillowcase sealed in a plastic bag was included in the blanket/pillow set.

Last year they were bad, now they are worst. Much worse. The tagging of the luggage was a never ending process with maximum bothering system, consisting in 3 different people from the Aegean trying to use scanners which were not working and redirecting us from one to the other. The process lasted long to infinite because we were seven persons in the group. Moreover, after that, when boarding the bus which lead to the plane, the personnel insisted in a more than aggressive voice and body language in us going into a very crowded bus in which there wasnt any room left for us. More than that, we explained that we could not separate the members of our group because we were 7 and not everyone was speaking english. They separated us nevertheless between two different buses and one of the passengers had a panic attack.

,Aegean Airlines,Economy Class,Jun-19,29th June 2019,5,5,5,UnitedStates,10,yes,"After a nightmare experience with United (who rebooked us with their Star Alliance partner Aegean) including several delays, and cancellations, we arrived in Athens to no luggage, which was United's responsibility, not Aegean's. We dealt with United for four days trying to get our luggage from Newark to Athens. Eventually they told us to Taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there, a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not, in fact, there. (We did not even ask for a supervisor.) He was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him. At this point our time in Athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship, thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean. The next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door! We couldn't believe it. The supervisor had gotten our luggage from Newark to Athens, then onto Santorini Island, where our Princess Cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day. In all we went five days without luggage, but once Aegean was involved we had it within about a day, in a much more difficult route than it would have been for United to simply put it on the plane to Athens. Everyone was so compassionate and kind. But it didn't end there. Upon arriving home, I began the impossible task of dealing with United to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had. We spent hours on hold, hours on the phone, getting nowhere. Finally, based on the File Reference number (that I'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the International agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage. Wait, so we get to deal with Aegean again? Wonderful! I called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email. In less than a day I got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly. I've spent three weeks with United and got nowhere, while being treated rudely. In the last few days everything has been submitted to Aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping.

I had to take an emergency flight back to the states because my father passed away suddenly. I searched on skyscanner and Aer Lingus was the cheapest so I booked it. I am a disabled passenger so requested wheelchair service, as I cant walk or stand for very long. I did not however receive a wheelchair at any point of the journey. And I wasn't pointed in the right direction to get one.  I flew out of London city which is a small airport so I was able to make it through security and to the gate. When I got to Dublin I waited for everyone to leave from the plane before I did, as it's easier and less of a pain standing and waiting behind people. There was quite a long walk to get down the plane steps and into the baggage area to then find my way to my connecting flight. I noticed on the baggage belt there was a suitcase similar to mine, it was in fact my suitcase! They were supposed to have transferred it onto my next flight to Philadelphia. Luckily I had seen this because who knows if it would have made it there. Anyway after trying to find someone to take my luggage I noticed a desk and I explained the situation and said they'd personally make sure it made it onto my next flight Between my connecting flight I had to go through security again, which annoyed me. At security I hadn't put the tray on the belt straight so staff called me back to do it. It was very condescending, when she could have easily done it herself. Once on the plane, it was very spacious as I was lucky enough to have both seats next to me empty, which made the trip very pleasant. My flight home was easier than the trip I had there. I would like to warn people not to purchase the wifi. I have never had an issue purchasing wifi on a flight before but to spend £6/€6 on what I thought would last longer than a couple minutes, I think is disgusting (They confirmed it lasted 4.4mins) I have disputed this and they refuse to refund or do anything about my complaint. Also they ran out of the choice of food on the plane, con of sitting towards the back end of the plane I suppose, but I don't think this should happen. Landing in dublin, it was early hours of the morning I again struggled to get to my next gate.

Afterwards, I checked reviews online and began getting worried as the common theme seemed to be that staff was horrible, planes were cramped, and they lose luggage often. With those images in my head I went to the airport in Amsterdam hoping for the best but expecting the worst. The staff at the counter was pleasant and although there are no boarding groups everyone got on the plane free from incident. The plane wasn't any more cramped than other budget airlines. After US preclearance in Dublin, I boarded a larger plane from there to San Francisco. The plane was about half full which gave us our pick of open seats and the flight attendants were surprisingly pleasant. In fact, one gave me an extra meal saying I ""looked like a growing lad"". Unfortunately, the food was terrible. I only had carry on baggage which was not scrutinized for its size.

,Aer Lingus,Economy Class,Jan-20,25th January 2020,0,0,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"I was flying from Frankfurt to Boston via Dublin. At the counter in Frankfurt I and about 20 other passengers were told by Aer Lingus staff that they would not check us in because Aer Lingus flights that day from Dublin into the US were cancelled. They did not give an explanation as to why although later I was told that it was 'operational problems'. We were sent to a separate desk with generic airport booking employees unrelated to Aer Lingus for rebooking. These airport people had to call the regular Aer Lingus hotlines in order to be able to rebook anyone, but these hotlines were busy for more than an hour, and the Aer Lingus people in those call center were only allowed to process 3 rebookings in a single call, drawing this whole process out unnecessarily. During this time the flight to Dublin had departed and the original Aer Lingus front desk people had disappeared. It took 3 hours until my rebooking was looked into, at which time most alternative transatlantic flight options for that day were gone. So were all the options with any of their partner airlines with which they allow free rebookings (of which there are few in the first place). So I was told to take a hotel and wait for a flight the next day.  I instead had to book a flight for the same day via British Airways via London on my own and had to pay over 2000EUR for that. Most of that money I now have as a loss, but at least according to EU regulation Aer Lingus owes me a compensation of 600EUR which would at least pay for a part of it. In phone calls and mail communication they have now started to claim that the flight had not been cancelled it had only been delayed and they don't owe me compensation. I checked the flight history on Flightaware and saw that EI0139 on 1/7 did indeed fly. The reason for this mess up I can't fathom. In any way, since they barred me from the flight, they owe me 600EUR regardless if the flight in the end would have been possible or not. While I'll eventually get the 600EUR, the time and money wasted so far both with the situation during the trip and dealing with them in the aftermath is enormous. And greatest is the disappointment with Aer Lingus. I have flow with them a couple of times and from those experiences had thought them to be a half way solid airline.

I would like to highlight here that the ""propaganda"" in the website about the lounge is already misleading. You are limited to a dark and often noisy and crowded area. I ended up preferring to stay in the airport. But my flight back from Beijing to Frankfurt was a complete nightmare. The crew were serving sea food. I called the air attendants and told them that I have a really strong allergy and the smell was already causing an allergic reaction. I faced a completely unprepared and careless crew. They didn't let me to leave my sit and just gave me tissues! I told them several times that I just needed to find a place away from the smell. I had to stay there, barely breathing and feeling sick the whole flight. Additionally, the service is super slow, food is bad and entertainment options are limited.

,Air China,Premium Economy,Apr-19,26th June 2019,1,1,1,UnitedStates,1,no,"New York to Bangkok via Beijing. I've been traveling for years and this is the 1st and last time I will ever use them. I just got married and my husband and I planned a 2 month honeymoon to Asia. We purchased a round trip from JFK with a layover in Beijing before arriving in Bangkok. The return flight was from Hong Kong with layover in Beijing before landing in Newark, NJ. Our flight in April to Bangkok experienced multiple delays which caused us to miss our layover in Beijing by 5 minutes. We actually had a 75 mins layover in Beijing, but due to the delays, we and almost everyone else on our plane missed our transfers. They couldn't tell their other planes to wait 5-10 mins for everyone to make their flights?? Instead, we saw most of the fliers crowded around the Air China counter. Everyone had to get a temporary visa and herd onto their buses to spend a night in a disgusting, filthy motel because the next flights out were the following day. My husband and I missed our 1st night in Bangkok and of course weren't reimbursed in any way. Throughout the ordeal, we saw all of the passengers at the Air China counters and they, like us, were appalled and furious with their lack of customer service. They just don't care. Now for our flight returning back to NY from Hong Kong on 6/17. We received an email saying that Air China changed our flights so we called Chase Travel. We saw that they changed the planes, times and moved us from Premium Economy to Economy. Why? We paid the extra amount for Economy. Once on the phone with Chase, we selected another flight for 7:30AM that was Premium Economy. We even waited on the phone until we received the email confirmation from Chase for our new flights. So on 6/17 we get to HK airport to check in and they only have my husband's name and not mine. Air China said I was on a 11PM flight and that it was Chase's fault. That was not the case. My husband and I spent hours on the phone with Chase and Air China, and Air China were the ones to cancel my ticket (we have no idea why). Instead of just putting me on the 7:30AM flight, they kept my husband on hold for 50 minutes, then finally told him that they could change his flight for $4000 to be with me for the 11PM. How does that make sense? Why are we being punished for Air China's mistake? They changed our flights then split us up but putting us on different flights that land in different airports. Then they have the audacity to tell him to pay $4000 for him to be on the 11PM when they could've just put me on the 7:30AM which was confirmed. They could have even put us on the next Air China flight after that. My husband ended up purchasing completely new flights with EVA which was $2800 compared to the $2500 round trip with Air China! It's now 7/25 and I've been on the phone with Chase for almost 4.5 hours because the supervisor is trying to get Air China to give us a refund. Rather than admitting their fault and giving us the credit owed, they are trying to contest it.

Then they upgraded their planes with thinner seats and less recline, (unfortunately most airlines have made this upgrade).  I find it rather ironic that they did this, when every study on air rage, shows that more comfort (aka more leg room and seat recline), reduces stress and air rage. So they did the exact opposite of what every study said they should do. So not only have they made a long haul flight, less comfort able, the prices have also been steadily creeping upwards, (I used to buy first class for what you now pay in premium economy). As a whole, the cabin crew has always been great to me, but you always get the odd one who may be having a bad day and are a bit more abrasive. When Rouge first started flying, I never had an issue with missing or delayed baggage. The last 4 flights I have had missing/delayed bags.

The main language is Russian (understandably) but flight attendents and announcements are done in English as well. There is no ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling from the flight attendents, but they are professional. Boarding the plane is all-at-once, chaotic. Best to be near the front of the boarding line, since Russians have a habit of trying to carry-on everything and the overhead bins fill quickly.

When my sister and I checked in for the Santorini to Athens flights we had two rollerbags which were labeled cabin baggage on check in by Aegean.

He would not let us on the plane unless we paid him. We finally paid to not hold up other travelers but in the confusion of this my purse was left on his counter.

I asked the three stewardesses at the front of the plane if I could retrieve my purse at that counter. The man charging us the baggage fee at the last minute could also have run the purse down, and didn't. I could not leave the plane to go up the ramp but they did not offer for one of them to get it for me and instead waited for a young baggage boy to go see it it was there.

The day we travelled in October must have been Dublin Airports worst day as it took a full 2 hours in a queue to reach the immigration desks. My question is - has Dublin and Aer Lingus expansion into even more US cities started to affect the smooth running of this service? So needless to say everyone was stressed and flight departure times looming so hungry and thirsty we raced to our aircraft 1/4 full and an hours delay. No refreshments offered to those on board waiting and no interaction at all from crew. We had a relatively new A330-300 on our outbound journey which was generally pleasant and clean. Entertainment system poor. 1 hour into the flight we got a soft drink, only non-alcoholic beverages were complimentary. We then got our main meal and 3 or 4 hours in a small tub of ice cream was delivered. No other soft drinks service came round. Everyone kept walking up and down the aircraft trying to get water. I have never travelled long haul and had such poor service. The return journey was on an older A330-200 which was noticeably poorer. Bad sound on the entertainment system. Smaller screens and even worse if not poorer service. As it was a night flight the crew were even more absent and we felt like we were in a desert having to beg for liquid refreshment.

Boeing 787-9,Aeromexico,Economy Class,Jan-20,7th January 2020,4,1,4,Germany,1,no,"We flew with Aeromexico from Amsterdam to Mexico City and return. On both flights the staff was very unpolite. In particular the treatment of passengers by female flight crew members is rude and without any service attitude that you would even find in cheap European airlines. Multiple times the flight crew was bumping against the edge seats. Food was dashed off on the table without a word. When asked if a meat or vegatarian dish was available, the answer was ""no, thats out already"" and walking away, rather than ""no sorry, but may I offer . instead"". Coffee/tea was offered by shouting through the cabin ""coffee? tea??"" rather than asking ""would you like a coffee?"". I witnessed that behaviour with all passengers around us likewise. I have never seen such unpolite and rude behaviour in any other European, American or Asian airline carrier. On top of all of that, the return flight was delayed by 1.5 hrs so that we missed our connecting flight, resulting in a 5 hrs. delay of arrival at our final destination. The answer of Aeromexico whether they can offer a compensation was: ""we can offer a sincere apology"". Finally, the flight was not even expensive, but above average for that route. All in all, I will never travel with Aeromexico again, but will rather resort to well established European or Asian carriers.",Mexico City to Amsterdam,2,1,aeromexico,staff was very unpolite,Couple Leisure,Trip Verified,1,1,b41ac0ae-750b-4ed4-a7df-eca595af52ee
Boeing 787-9,Aeromexico,Economy Class,Dec-19,19th December 2019,3,2,1,Germany,1,no,"AeroMexico from Mexico City to Amsterdam. As Ticket package i booked the ""Classic Package"", which included selecting a seat and luggage up to 23KG included (this package is ~70US$ more expensive, than the basic fare without luggage and seat reservation one-way!). I did the online-checkin-process, which went very smooth and chose my seat. One hour before departure i checked again in the customer-page, if everything was fine - it was and my seat was still blocked for me and the whole row (two more seats free). Until here everything was perfect. But then the boarding started.  My digital boarding pass on my smartphone was rejected several times, so the ground-stuff-guy went with me to the counter and gave me a printed boarding pass with another seat. I asked why they changed my seat without further announcement or communication to me, as passenger? After all i paid additional money, to choose my seat, but now the ground staff changed my seat. He just said, i shouldn't be so excited, it is exactly the same place, just in another part of the airplane. I again started discussing with him, that this behaviour is wrong, changing the booked and additionally paid seats of the customers - but he just turned around and went away. Consequently i ended on the seat directly in front of the toilets, where the seat recline was much less, than on my booked seat - sleeping was a torture for this overnight-connection. My original booked seat got a woman with a kid of about 12 years, they blocked obviously the three seats and laid flat down all the way to Amsterdam. But it is unbelievable, that people, who paid additional money for reserving a seat are removed and moved to another seat, while others, who didn't pay and reserve their seat before, get benefits for free. They could have gotten those seats, but then they needed to pay also additional money for getting this comfort. The stewardess in the airplane was completely incompetent. I showed her the two boarding-passes and she just said in a rude way, that my digital boarding pass is invalid and now i need to move. No offer for an upgrade to the premium-economy or business for this impudence. So, reserving seats against money is in AeroMexico no good option, you anyway have no guarantee to get your reserved and booked seat.

Because of renovations at Terminal 1 at México City airport we were forced to deplane using stairs and walk to a shuttle bus. I had a cane and was able with the help of my husband to get to the bus. The other lady, however, who was alone, received absolutely no help from flight attendants or ground crew to get down the stairs which she painfully managed by holding on to one rail with both hands and moving both legs onto each step. Once on the ground, she received no help either with walking to the bus or getting on the bus. Eventually, some other passengers helped her onto the bus and my husband gave up his seat for her while 2 ground employees occupied 2 seats. At the terminal I had to urge the said employees to help her off the bus and in the terminal was a wheelchair for her but not one for me despite having arranging on the ticket for one. This was despicable treatment of both flight and ground staff in ignoring the needs of a disadvantaged person. This is the second time we have transited via México City en route to another destination. A month ago we were travelling with Aeromexico from Vancouver to Panamá City and this was the return trip today. On the first occasion México City to Panamá City I had to walk down several flights of stairs from the gate to get to the bus and then climb upstairs onto the plane.

A representative at the gate refused to board our entire family of 5 people (including 6 yrs old daughter) because we passed on to him all 5 passports and boarding passes in one pile (like we usually do everywhere else in the World). Instead he wanted us to enclose each boarding pass into the corresponding passport. It took us about 20 seconds to do so. However the representative tried to send us back to the end of the line. Moreover while discussing he detached an immigration/visitors form from my son's boarding pass (we all have seen him doing so) and few minutes later he claimed we didn't submit the form and he has a right to cancel our flight. To my request to call for his manager and solve the problem hi simply replied 'I'm going to call for a police.

At that time I was already in Gainesville, GA. The delivery company had called me while I was in the meeting.

Their website is difficult to navigate and the link to Aeroplan is less than stellar. They also are not very accommodating making sure folks stay hydrated in the air. Trying to call or electronically communicate forget it, no answer. Unfortunately, the price of the tickets is no different than any other airline. It does show when there are no regulations and big corporations like Air Canada can do what they want and treat their customers any way they choose. Sometimes a little regulation goes a long way.

I remember asking for a tissue on the way back as I was quite sick and the air hostess said she would help after serving the food. So I waited and nothing. I didn't bother reminding her again. I used the restroom. Later on during the flight I had a question and pressed the button and nothing. I understand staff get busy and that's no problem. However, I pressed that button over 5 times throughout the flight and not a single host came to address my inquiry. From the moment we tried to board until the very end, there wasn't a single rep I could give a shout out to. The attitude was aggressive and arrogant. A little mindfulness goes a long way and the staff in my opinion need to significantly up their game. The job isn't merely to serve food on the plane but to make sure all travellers are respected and responded to with basic kindness.  Of course this is just my one such experience there may have been others out there who've had a pleasant experience with this airline.",Lima to Toronto,1,1,air-canada-rouge,subpar in their customer service,Solo Leisure,Trip Verified,1,0,1b4c01ba-3711-4ad7-9e00-a40fbd0e42b7

Faultless, new aircrafts. 100% punctual. Not much pleasures onboard apart from an OK working IFE system on the long sector only. Very strict at check-in in CPH and had to rearrange luggage twice as to meet practiced requirements as they deny more than 10 kg hand-luggage. I had no privileges in their FFProgramme, so could not claim much rights, apart from being entitled to 23 kg according to the tickets which was very cheap (450 USD return, purchased online almost a year earlier. 6 months ticket). Service onboard mediocre on the short haul, but for the price paid, you’ll survive. Transfer in Moscow very quick and smooth, less than 5 Minutes for security and immigration check. On the long haul to SGN (12 hours+) hot meals (2-3 options!) and drinks/wines were served for the first half of the flight until they “ran out” (not true, its merely cost saving or fear of drunks). Hot meals were very good: supper service offered 2 options and breakfast 3 hot options. Wines were surprisingly good, to my taste they were excellent and well chosen. IFE the best I have encountered and easy to operate. Good value for money, but please travel light. Got 75% miles to their FFP, which will be enough to a long-haul upgrade after 3-5 more legs. Staff onboard professional though appear more cynical than truly caring. Load in economy approx. 75% full for both flights. Was lucky and had 4 seats in a row to stretch out though next to the toilets. Luggage delivery in Saigon took 1½ hour, likely the service provider messed up.

Flight to Ust-Kamenogorsk via Almaty not too bad or unpleasant considering I was en route already for 25 days (spending 18 hours in horrible Dubai Airport). My suitcase was damaged by rough handling. The flight Ust-Kamenogorsk to Astana was not bad either. Astana-Dubai flight started with a hiccup - since the customs people did not know where Namibia is and I was looked at very suspiciously despite having a private Visa and being with my Kazakhstan wife. The flight was very unpleasant - seats the most uncomfortable for such a flight! Attendants not interested in making the flight a wee-bit more comfortable. Prices not too bad - however flying to the destinations I need to go to there is no alternative to compare.

Although we checked in on the website they couldn't provide the same seats so we had to sit separately from my wife. They also sold 1 ticket for 2 people but they just couldn't do anything with the situation. The only way would've been to seat one of these guys to the business class. We waited 2 hours on the plane (of course some people missed their connection in Bangkok in the result of this unprofessionalism) until they saw no other solution but that.

If it were not for their lack of baggage handling abilities, we would have been repeat customers. Although the flight itself was pleasant and comfortable, upon my arrival in Los Angeles, I discovered that I had some items stolen from my luggage. My partner's bag was also destroyed, the zipper ripped from the bag and his bag arrived to us in a plastic bag on a plastic tray. When I contacted Aeromexico to resolve the issue, their customer service team informed me that they did not recommend valuables be stored in check in bags. I asked if they would seek to implement measures to ensure their duty of care on the contents of check in bags were met (as of course, you cannot put everything into your carry on if you are travelling for an extended period of time). Their team merely responded with 'I do understand your displeasure regarding this situation. In this case, I can only provide you with the corresponding information regarding our baggage allowance rules and policies'.
